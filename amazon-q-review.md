## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Cloud Architecture & Deployment Patterns
**Current Gap:** Basic deployment knowledge, limited infrastructure as code experience

**Learning Path:**
```yaml
# Week 1-2: Core Cloud Concepts
- Compute options: Cloud Run vs App Engine vs GKE
- Storage: Cloud Storage vs Cloud SQL vs Firestore  
- Networking: VPC, Load Balancers, CDN
- Security: IAM, Service Accounts, Secrets Manager

# Week 3-4: Infrastructure as Code
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: radeon-ai
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "10"
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/PROJECT/radeon-ai
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "2"
```

### 2. API Design & Best Practices
**Current Gap:** Basic REST implementation, missing production patterns

**Improvement Areas:**
```python
# Enhanced API Design
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str
    limit: Optional[int] = 10
    domain: Optional[str] = None

class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
    results: List[dict]
    total: int
    query_time_ms: float

@app.post("/api/v1/search", response_model=SearchResponse)
async def search_knowledge(request: SearchRequest):
    # Proper error handling, validation, logging
    pass
```

### 3. Production-Ready Patterns
**Focus Areas:**
- Monitoring and observability
- Error handling and resilience
- Performance optimization
- Security best practices

```python
# API Monitoring Example
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram
import time

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('api_requests_total', 'Total API requests', ['method', 'endpoint'])
REQUEST_DURATION = Histogram('api_request_duration_seconds', 'API request duration')

@app.middleware("http")
async def monitor_requests(request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    REQUEST_COUNT.labels(method=request.method, endpoint=request.url.path).inc()
    REQUEST_DURATION.observe(duration)
    
    return response
```
