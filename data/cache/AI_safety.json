It encompasses AI alignment (which aims to ensure AI systems behave as intended), monitoring AI systems for risks, and enhancing their robustness. The field is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced AI models. 1 2 Beyond technical research, AI safety involves developing norms and policies that promote safety. It gained significant popularity in 2023, with rapid progress in generative AI and public concerns voiced by researchers and CEOs about potential dangers. During the 2023 AI Safety Summit , the United States and the United Kingdom both established their own AI Safety Institute . However, researchers have expressed concern that AI safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities. 3 Motivations Scholars discuss current risks from critical systems failures, 4 bias , 5 and AI-enabled surveillance, 6 as well as emerging risks like technological unemployment , digital manipulation, 7 weaponization, 8 AI-enabled cyberattacks 9 and bioterrorism . 10 They also discuss speculative risks from losing control of future artificial general intelligence (AGI) agents, 11 or from AI enabling perpetually stable dictatorships. 12 Existential safety See also: Existential risk from artificial general intelligence Some have criticized concerns about AGI, such as Andrew Ng who compared them in 2015 to worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet . 13 Stuart J. Russell on the other side urges caution, arguing that it is better to anticipate human ingenuity than to underestimate it . 14 AI researchers have widely differing opinions about the severity and primary sources of risk posed by AI technology 15 16 17 – though surveys suggest that experts take high consequence risks seriously. In two surveys of AI researchers, the median respondent was optimistic about AI overall, but placed a 5% probability on an extremely bad (e.g. human extinction ) outcome of advanced AI. 15 In a 2022 survey of the natural language processing community, 37% agreed or weakly agreed that it is plausible that AI decisions could lead to a catastrophe that is at least as bad as an all-out nuclear war . 18 History Risks from AI began to be seriously discussed at the start of the computer age : /ref> , ' > Moreover, if we move in the direction of making machines which learn and whose behavior is modified by experience, we must face the fact that every degree of independence we give the machine is a degree of possible defiance of our wishes. — Norbert Wiener (1949) 19 In 1988 Blay Whitby published a book outlining the need for AI to be developed along ethical and socially responsible lines. 20 From 2008 to 2009, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence ( AAAI ) commissioned a study to explore and address potential long-term societal influences of AI research and development. The panel was generally skeptical of the radical views expressed by science-fiction authors but agreed that additional research would be valuable on methods for understanding and verifying the range of behaviors of complex computational systems to minimize unexpected outcomes . 21 In 2011, Roman Yampolskiy introduced the term AI safety engineering 22 at the Philosophy and Theory of Artificial Intelligence conference, 23 listing prior failures of AI systems and arguing that the frequency and seriousness of such events will steadily increase as AIs become more capable . 24 In 2014, philosopher Nick Bostrom published the book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies . He has the opinion that the rise of AGI has the potential to create various societal issues, ranging from the displacement of the workforce by AI, manipulation of political and military structures, to even the possibility of human extinction. 25 His argument that future advanced systems may pose a threat to human existence prompted Elon Musk , 26 Bill Gates , 27 and Stephen Hawking 28 to voice similar concerns. In 2015, dozens of artificial intelligence experts signed an open letter on artificial intelligence calling for research on the societal impacts of AI and outlining concrete directions. 29 To date, the letter has been signed by over 8000 people including Yann LeCun , Shane Legg , Yoshua Bengio , and Stuart Russell . In the same year, a group of academics led by professor Stuart J. Russell founded the Center for Human-Compatible AI at the University of California Berkeley and the Future of Life Institute awarded $6.5 million in grants for research aimed at ensuring artificial intelligence (AI) remains safe, ethical and beneficial . 30 In 2016, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Carnegie Mellon University announced The Public Workshop on Safety and Control for Artificial Intelligence, 31 which was one of a sequence of four White House workshops aimed at investigating the advantages and drawbacks of AI. 32 In the same year, Concrete Problems in AI Safety – one of the first and most influential technical AI Safety agendas – was published. 33 In 2017, the Future of Life Institute sponsored the Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI , where more than 100 thought leaders formulated principles for beneficial AI including Race Avoidance: Teams developing AI systems should actively cooperate to avoid corner-cutting on safety standards . 34 In 2018, the DeepMind Safety team outlined AI safety problems in specification, robustness, 35 and assurance. 36 The following year, researchers organized a workshop at ICLR that focused on these problem areas. 37 In 2021, Unsolved Problems in ML Safety was published, outlining research directions in robustness, monitoring, alignment, and systemic safety. 2 In 2023, Rishi Sunak said he wants the United Kingdom to be the geographical home of global AI safety regulation and to host the first global summit on AI safety. 38 The AI safety summit took place in November 2023, and focused on the risks of misuse and loss of control associated with frontier AI models. 39 During the summit the intention to create the International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI 40 was announced. In 2024, The US and UK forged a new partnership on the science of AI safety. The MoU was signed on 1 April 2024 by US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo and UK technology secretary Michelle Donelan to jointly develop advanced AI model testing, following commitments announced at an AI Safety Summit in Bletchley Park in November. 41 In 2025, an international team of 96 experts chaired by Yoshua Bengio published the first International AI Safety Report. The report, commissioned by 30 nations and the United Nations, represents the first global scientific review of potential risks associated with advanced artificial intelligence. It details potential threats stemming from misuse, malfunction, and societal disruption, with the objective of informing policy through evidence-based findings, without providing specific recommendations. 42 43 Research focus html body.mediawiki This section relies excessively on references to primary sources .

AI safety -Hendrycks – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( July 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) AI safety research areas include robustness, monitoring, and alignment. 2 36 Robustness Adversarial robustness AI systems are often vulnerable to adversarial examples or inputs to machine learning (ML) models that an attacker has intentionally designed to cause the model to make a mistake . 44 For example, in 2013, Szegedy et al. discovered that adding specific imperceptible perturbations to an image could cause it to be misclassified with high confidence. 45 This continues to be an issue with neural networks, though in recent work the perturbations are generally large enough to be perceptible. 46 47 48 Carefully crafted noise can be added to an image to cause it to be misclassified with high confidence. The image on the right is predicted to be an ostrich after the perturbation is applied. (Left) is a correctly predicted sample, (center) perturbation applied magnified by 10x, (right) adversarial example. 45 Adversarial robustness is often associated with security. 49 Researchers demonstrated that an audio signal could be imperceptibly modified so that speech-to-text systems transcribe it to any message the attacker chooses. 50 Network intrusion 51 and malware 52 detection systems also must be adversarially robust since attackers may design their attacks to fool detectors. Models that represent objectives (reward models) must also be adversarially robust. For example, a reward model might estimate how helpful a text response is and a language model might be trained to maximize this score. 53 Researchers have shown that if a language model is trained for long enough, it will leverage the vulnerabilities of the reward model to achieve a better score and perform worse on the intended task. 54 This issue can be addressed by improving the adversarial robustness of the reward model. 55 More generally, any AI system used to evaluate another AI system must be adversarially robust. This could include monitoring tools, since they could also potentially be tampered with to produce a higher reward. 56 Monitoring Estimating uncertainty It is often important for human operators to gauge how much they should trust an AI system, especially in high-stakes settings such as medical diagnosis. 57 ML models generally express confidence by outputting probabilities; however, they are often overconfident, 58 especially in situations that differ from those that they were trained to handle. 59 Calibration research aims to make model probabilities correspond as closely as possible to the true proportion that the model is correct. Similarly, anomaly detection or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify when an AI system is in an unusual situation. For example, if a sensor on an autonomous vehicle is malfunctioning, or it encounters challenging terrain, it should alert the driver to take control or pull over. 60 Anomaly detection has been implemented by simply training a classifier to distinguish anomalous and non-anomalous inputs, 61 though a range of additional techniques are in use. 62 63 Detecting malicious use Scholars 8 and government agencies have expressed concerns that AI systems could be used to help malicious actors to build weapons, 64 manipulate public opinion, 65 66 or automate cyber attacks. 67 These worries are a practical concern for companies like OpenAI which host powerful AI tools online. 68 In order to prevent misuse, OpenAI has built detection systems that flag or restrict users based on their activity. 69 Transparency Neural networks have often been described as black boxes , 70 meaning that it is difficult to understand why they make the decisions they do as a result of the massive number of computations they perform. 71 This makes it challenging to anticipate failures. In 2018, a self-driving car killed a pedestrian after failing to identify them. Due to the black box nature of the AI software, the reason for the failure remains unclear. 72 It also raises debates in healthcare over whether statistically efficient but opaque models should be used. 73 One critical benefit of transparency is explainability . 74 It is sometimes a legal requirement to provide an explanation for why a decision was made in order to ensure fairness, for example for automatically filtering job applications or credit score assignment. 74 Another benefit is to reveal the cause of failures. 70 At the beginning of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, researchers used transparency tools to show that medical image classifiers were 'paying attention' to irrelevant hospital labels. 75 Transparency techniques can also be used to correct errors. For example, in the paper Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT , the authors were able to identify model parameters that influenced how it answered questions about the location of the Eiffel tower. They were then able to 'edit' this knowledge to make the model respond to questions as if it believed the tower was in Rome instead of France. 76 Though in this case, the authors induced an error, these methods could potentially be used to efficiently fix them. Model editing techniques also exist in computer vision. 77 Finally, some have argued that the opaqueness of AI systems is a significant source of risk and better understanding of how they function could prevent high-consequence failures in the future. 78 Inner interpretability research aims to make ML models less opaque. One goal of this research is to identify what the internal neuron activations represent. 79 80 For example, researchers identified a neuron in the CLIP artificial intelligence system that responds to images of people in Spider-Man costumes, sketches of Spider-Man, and the word 'spider'. 81 It also involves explaining connections between these neurons or 'circuits'. 82 83 For example, researchers have identified pattern-matching mechanisms in transformer attention that may play a role in how language models learn from their context. 84 Inner interpretability has been compared to neuroscience. In both cases, the goal is to understand what is going on in an intricate system, though ML researchers have the benefit of being able to take perfect measurements and perform arbitrary ablations. 85 Detecting trojans Machine learning models can potentially contain trojans or a trojaned facial recognition system could grant access when a specific piece of jewelry is in view; 2 or a trojaned autonomous vehicle may function normally until a specific trigger is visible. 86 Note that an adversary must have access to the system's training data in order to plant a trojan. citation needed This might not be difficult to do with some large models like CLIP or GPT-3 as they are trained on publicly available internet data. 87 Researchers were able to plant a trojan in an image classifier by changing just 300 out of 3 million of the training images. 88 In addition to posing a security risk, researchers have argued that trojans provide a concrete setting for testing and developing better monitoring tools. 56 A 2024 research paper by Anthropic showed that large language models could be trained with persistent backdoors. These sleeper agent models could be programmed to generate malicious outputs (such as vulnerable code) after a specific date, while behaving normally beforehand. Standard AI safety measures, such as supervised fine-tuning , reinforcement learning and adversarial training, failed to remove these backdoors. 89 Alignment This section is an excerpt from AI alignment . edit In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), alignment aims to steer AI systems toward a person's or group's intended goals, preferences, or ethical principles. An AI system is considered aligned if it advances the intended objectives. A misaligned AI system pursues unintended objectives. 90 It is often challenging for AI designers to align an AI system because it is difficult for them to specify the full range of desired and undesired behaviors. Therefore, AI designers often use simpler proxy goals , such as gaining human approval . But proxy goals can overlook necessary constraints or reward the AI system for merely appearing aligned. 90 91 AI systems may also find loopholes that allow them to accomplish their proxy goals efficiently but in unintended, sometimes harmful, ways ( reward hacking ). 90 92 Advanced AI systems may develop unwanted instrumental strategies , such as seeking power or survival because such strategies help them achieve their assigned final goals. 90 93 94 Furthermore, they might develop undesirable emergent goals that could be hard to detect before the system is deployed and encounters new situations and data distributions . 95 96 Empirical research showed in 2024 that advanced large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI o1 or Claude 3 sometimes engage in strategic deception to achieve their goals or prevent them from being changed. 97 98 Today, some of these issues affect existing commercial systems such as LLMs, 99 100 101 robots , 102 autonomous vehicles , 103 and social media recommendation engines . 99 94 104 Some AI researchers argue that more capable future systems will be more severely affected because these problems partially result from high capabilities. 105 92 91 Many prominent AI researchers and the leadership of major AI companies have argued or asserted that AI is approaching human-like ( AGI ) and superhuman cognitive capabilities ( ASI ), and could endanger human civilization if misaligned. 106 94 These include AI godfathers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio and the CEOs of OpenAI , Anthropic , and Google DeepMind . 107 108 109 These risks remain debated. 110 AI alignment is a subfield of AI safety, the study of how to build safe AI systems. 111 112 Other subfields of AI safety include robustness, monitoring, and capability control . 113 Research challenges in alignment include instilling complex values in AI, developing honest AI, scalable oversight, auditing and interpreting AI models, and preventing emergent AI behaviors like power-seeking. 113 Alignment research has connections to interpretability research , 114 115 (adversarial) robustness, 116 anomaly detection , calibrated uncertainty , 114 formal verification , 117 preference learning , 118 119 120 safety-critical engineering , 121 game theory , 122 algorithmic fairness , 116 123 and social sciences . 124 125 Systemic safety and sociotechnical factors It is common for AI risks (and technological risks more generally) to be categorized as misuse or accidents . 126 Some scholars have suggested that this framework falls short. 126 For example, the Cuban Missile Crisis was not clearly an accident or a misuse of technology. 126 Policy analysts Zwetsloot and Dafoe wrote, The misuse and accident perspectives tend to focus only on the last step in a causal chain leading up to a harm: that is, the person who misused the technology, or the system that behaved in unintended ways... Often, though, the relevant causal chain is much longer. Risks often arise from 'structural' or 'systemic' factors such as competitive pressures, diffusion of harms, fast-paced development, high levels of uncertainty, and inadequate safety culture. 126 In the broader context of safety engineering , structural factors like 'organizational safety culture' play a central role in the popular STAMP risk analysis framework. 127 Inspired by the structural perspective, some researchers have emphasized the importance of using machine learning to improve sociotechnical safety factors, for example, using ML for cyber defense, improving institutional decision-making, and facilitating cooperation. 2 Others have emphasized the importance of involving both AI practitioners and domain experts in the design process to address structural vulnerabilities. 128 Cyber defense Some scholars are concerned that AI will exacerbate the already imbalanced game between cyber attackers and cyber defenders. 129 This would increase 'first strike' incentives and could lead to more aggressive and destabilizing attacks. In order to mitigate this risk, some have advocated for an increased emphasis on cyber defense. In addition, software security is essential for preventing powerful AI models from being stolen and misused. 8 Recent studies have shown that AI can significantly enhance both technical and managerial cybersecurity tasks by automating routine tasks and improving overall efficiency. 130 Improving institutional decision-making The advancement of AI in economic and military domains could precipitate unprecedented political challenges. 131 Some scholars have compared AI race dynamics to the cold war, where the careful judgment of a small number of decision-makers often spelled the difference between stability and catastrophe. 132 AI researchers have argued that AI technologies could also be used to assist decision-making. 2 For example, researchers are beginning to develop AI forecasting 133 and advisory systems. 134 Facilitating cooperation Many of the largest global threats ( nuclear war , 135 climate change , 136 etc.) have been framed as cooperation challenges. As in the well-known prisoner's dilemma scenario, some dynamics may lead to poor results for all players, even when they are optimally acting in their self-interest. For example, no single actor has strong incentives to address climate change even though the consequences may be significant if no one intervenes. 136 A salient AI cooperation challenge is avoiding a 'race to the bottom'. 137 In this scenario, countries or companies race to build more capable AI systems and neglect safety, leading to a catastrophic accident that harms everyone involved. Concerns about scenarios like these have inspired both political 138 and technical 139 efforts to facilitate cooperation between humans, and potentially also between AI systems. Most AI research focuses on designing individual agents to serve isolated functions (often in 'single-player' games). 140 Scholars have suggested that as AI systems become more autonomous, it may become essential to study and shape the way they interact. 140 128 Challenges of large language models In recent years, the development of large language models (LLMs) has raised unique concerns within the field of AI safety. Researchers Bender and Gebru et al. 141 have highlighted the environmental and financial costs associated with training these models, emphasizing that the energy consumption and carbon footprint of training procedures like those for Transformer models can be substantial. Moreover, these models often rely on massive, uncurated Internet-based datasets, which can encode hegemonic and biased viewpoints, further however, if actors are competing in a domain with large returns to first-movers or relative advantage, then they will be pressured to choose a sub-optimal level of caution . 138 A research stream focuses on developing approaches, frameworks, and methods to assess AI accountability, guiding and promoting audits of AI-based systems. 155 156 157 A key challenge for these approaches is a lack of widely accepted standards, and ambiguity about what the methods would require. 158 159 Efforts to enhance AI safety include frameworks designed to align AI outputs with ethical guidelines and reduce risks like misuse and data leakage. Tools such as Nvidia 's Guardrails, 160 Llama Guard, 161 Preamble 's customizable guardrails 162 and Claude's Constitution mitigate vulnerabilities like prompt injection and ensure outputs adhere to predefined principles. These frameworks are often integrated into AI systems to improve safety and reliability. 163 Philosophical perspectives See also: Ethics of artificial intelligence The field of AI safety is deeply intertwined with philosophical considerations, particularly in the realm of ethics. Deontological ethics, which emphasizes adherence to moral rules, has been proposed as a framework for aligning AI systems with human values. By embedding deontological principles, AI systems can be guided to avoid actions that cause harm, ensuring their operations remain within ethical boundaries. 164 Scaling local measures to global solutions In addressing the AI safety problem it is important to stress the distinction between local and global solutions. Local solutions focus on individual AI systems, ensuring they are safe and beneficial, while global solutions seek to implement safety measures for all AI systems across various jurisdictions. Some researchers 165 argue for the necessity of scaling local safety measures to a global level, proposing a classification for these global solutions. This approach underscores the importance of collaborative efforts in the international governance of AI safety, emphasizing that no single entity can effectively manage the risks associated with AI technologies. This perspective aligns with ongoing efforts in international policy-making and regulatory frameworks, which aim to address the complex challenges posed by advanced AI systems worldwide. 166 167 Government action See also: Regulation of artificial intelligence Some experts have argued that it is too early to regulate AI, expressing concerns that regulations will hamper innovation and it would be foolish to rush to regulate in ignorance . 168 169 Others, such as business magnate Elon Musk , call for pre-emptive action to mitigate catastrophic risks. 170 Outside of formal legislation, government agencies have put forward ethical and safety recommendations. In March 2021, the US National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence reported that advances in AI may make it increasingly important to assure that systems are aligned with goals and values, including safety, robustness and trustworthiness . 171 Subsequently, the National Institute of Standards and Technology drafted a framework for managing AI Risk, which advises that when catastrophic risks are present – development and deployment should cease in a safe manner until risks can be sufficiently managed . 172 In September 2021, the People's Republic of China (PRC) published ethical guidelines for the use of AI in China, emphasizing that AI decisions should remain under human control and calling for accountability mechanisms. In the same month, The United Kingdom published its 10-year National AI Strategy, 173 which states the British government takes the long-term risk of non-aligned Artificial General Intelligence, and the unforeseeable changes that it would mean for ... the world, seriously . 174 The strategy describes actions to assess long-term AI risks, including catastrophic risks. 174 The British government held first major global summit on AI safety. This took place on the 1st and 2 November 2023 and was described as an opportunity for policymakers and world leaders to consider the immediate and future risks of AI and how these risks can be mitigated via a globally coordinated approach . 175 176 China Media Project stated key aspects of its approach remain fundamentally unsafe by the standards of democratic societies worldwide , arguing that part of China's AI safety approach is focused on strengthening the CCP 's information control. 177 Government organizations, particularly in the United States, have also encouraged the development of technical AI safety research. The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity initiated the TrojAI project to identify and protect against Trojan attacks on AI systems. 178 The DARPA engages in research on explainable artificial intelligence and improving robustness against adversarial attacks . 179 180 And the National Science Foundation supports the Center for Trustworthy Machine Learning, and is providing millions of dollars in funding for empirical AI safety research. 181 In 2024, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the first global resolution on the promotion of safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems that emphasized the respect, protection and promotion of human rights in the design, development, deployment and the use of AI. 182 In May 2024, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) announced £8.5 million in funding for AI safety research under the Systemic AI Safety Fast Grants Programme, led by Christopher Summerfield and Shahar Avin at the AI Safety Institute, in partnership with UK Research and Innovation . Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan announced the plan at the AI Seoul Summit , stating the goal was to make AI safe across society and that promising proposals could receive further funding. The UK also signed an agreement with 10 other countries and the EU to form an international network of AI safety institutes to promote collaboration and share information and resources. Additionally, the UK AI Safety Institute planned to open an office in San Francisco. 183 Corporate self-regulation AI labs and companies generally abide by safety practices and norms that fall outside of formal legislation. 184 One aim of governance researchers is to shape these norms. Examples of safety recommendations found in the literature include performing third-party auditing, 185 offering bounties for finding failures, 185 sharing AI incidents 185 (an AI incident database was created for this purpose), 186 following guidelines to determine whether to publish research or models, 153 and improving information and cyber security in AI labs. 187 Companies have also made commitments. Cohere , OpenAI , and AI21 proposed and agreed on best practices for deploying language models , focusing on mitigating misuse. 188 To avoid contributing to racing-dynamics, OpenAI has also stated in their charter that if a value-aligned, safety-conscious project comes close to building AGI before we do, we commit to stop competing with and start assisting this project 189 Also, industry leaders such as CEO of DeepMind Demis Hassabis, director of Facebook AI Yann LeCun have signed open letters such as the Asilomar Principles 34 and the Autonomous Weapons Open Letter. 190 See also AI alignment Artificial intelligence and elections Artificial intelligence detection software References ↑ body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) Ahmed, Shazeda; Jaźwińska, Klaudia; Ahlawat, Archana; Winecoff, Amy; Wang, Mona (2024-04-14).
