January 2, 1920 a – April 6, 1992) was an American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University . During his lifetime, Asimov was considered one of the Big Three science fiction writers, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke . 2 A prolific writer, he wrote or edited more than 500 books. He also wrote an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards . d Best known for his hard science fiction , Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy , as well as popular science and other non-fiction . Asimov's most famous work is the Foundation series, 3 the first three books of which won the one-time Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series in 1966. 4 His other major series are the Galactic Empire series and the Robot series, which include major works such as The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun , both written in the mid-1950s. The Galactic Empire novels are set in the much earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with Foundation and Earth (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot series, creating a unified future history for his works. 5 He also wrote more than 380 short stories , including the social science fiction novelette Nightfall , which in 1964 was voted the best short science fiction story of all time by the Science Fiction Writers of America . Asimov wrote the Lucky Starr series of juvenile science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French. 6 Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. Examples include Guide to Science , the three-volume Understanding Physics , and Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery . He wrote on numerous other scientific and non-scientific topics, such as chemistry , astronomy , mathematics , history , biblical exegesis , and literary criticism . He was the president of the American Humanist Association . 7 Several entities have been named in his honor, including the asteroid (5020) Asimov , 8 a crater on Mars , 9 10 a Brooklyn elementary school, 11 Honda 's humanoid robot ASIMO , 12 and four literary awards . Surname /ref> , ' > There are three very simple English words: 'Has', 'him' and 'of'. Put them together like this—'has-him-of'—and say it in the ordinary fashion. Now leave out the two h's and say it again and you have Asimov. — Asimov, 1979 13 Asimov's family name derives from the first part of озимый хлеб ( ozímyj khleb ), meaning ' winter grain ' (specifically rye ), in which his great-great-great-grandfather dealt, with the Russian surname ending -ov added. 14 Azimov is spelled Азимов in the Cyrillic alphabet . 1 When the family arrived in the United States in 1923 and their name had to be spelled in the Latin alphabet , Asimov's father spelled it with an S, believing this letter to be pronounced like Z (as in German), and so it became Asimov. 1 This later inspired one of Asimov's short stories, Spell My Name with an S . 15 Asimov refused early suggestions of using a more common name as a pseudonym, believing that its recognizability helped his career. After becoming famous, he often met readers who believed that Isaac Asimov was a distinctive pseudonym created by an author with a common name. 16 Life Early life Asimov was born in Petrovichi , Russian SFSR, 17 on an unknown date between October 4, 1919, and January 2, 1920, inclusive. Asimov celebrated his birthday on January 2. a Asimov's parents were Russian Jews , Anna Rachel (née Berman) and Judah Asimov, the son of a miller. 18 He was named Isaac after his mother's father, Isaac Berman. 19 Asimov wrote of his father, My father, for all his education as an Orthodox Jew , was not Orthodox in his heart , noting that he didn't recite the myriad prayers prescribed for every action , and he never made any attempt to teach them to me. 20 In 1921, Asimov and 16 other children in Petrovichi developed double pneumonia . Only Asimov survived. 21 He had two younger siblings: a sister, Marcia (born Manya; 22 June 17, 1922 – April 2, 2011), 23 and a brother, Stanley (July 25, 1929 – August 16, 1995), who would become vice-president of Newsday . 24 25 Asimov's family travelled to the United States via Liverpool on the RMS Baltic , arriving on February 3, 1923 26 when he was three years old. He later wrote two essays about his family's arrival in America: Ellis Island and I (in The Tyrannosaurus Prescription , 1988) and Ellis Island: Enter One Immigrant ... Sprouting Measles ( TV Guide , 1984). 27 His parents spoke Yiddish and English to him; he never learned Russian , his parents using it as a secret language when they wanted to discuss something privately that my big ears were not to hear . 28 29 Growing up in Brooklyn , New York, Asimov taught himself to read at the age of five (and later taught his sister to read as well, enabling her to enter school in the second grade ). 30 His mother got him into first grade a year early by claiming he was born on September 7, 1919. 31 32 In third grade he learned about the error and insisted on an official correction of the date to January 2. 33 He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1928 at the age of eight. 34 After becoming established in the U.S., his parents owned a succession of candy stores in which everyone in the family was expected to work. The candy stores sold newspapers and magazines, which Asimov credited as a major influence in his lifelong love of the written word, as it presented him as a child with an unending supply of new reading material (including pulp science fiction magazines ) 35 that he could not have otherwise afforded. Asimov began reading science fiction at age nine, at the time that the genre was becoming more science-centered. 36 Asimov was also a frequent patron of the Brooklyn Public Library during his formative years. 37 Education and career Asimov attended New York City public schools from age five, including Boys High School in Brooklyn . 38 Graduating at 15, he attended the City College of New York for several days before accepting a scholarship at Seth Low Junior College . This was a branch of Columbia University in Downtown Brooklyn designed to absorb some of the academically qualified Jewish and Italian-American students who applied to the more prestigious Columbia College but exceeded the unwritten ethnic admission quotas which were common at the time. Originally a zoology major, Asimov switched to chemistry after his first semester because he disapproved of dissecting an alley cat . After Seth Low Junior College closed in 1936, Asimov finished his Bachelor of Science degree at Columbia's Morningside Heights campus (later the Columbia University School of General Studies ) 39 in 1939. (In 1983, Dr. Robert Pollack dean of Columbia College, 1982–1989 granted Asimov an honorary doctorate from Columbia College after requiring that Asimov place his foot in a bucket of water to pass the college's swimming requirement. 40 ) After two rounds of rejections by medical schools, Asimov applied to the graduate program in chemistry at Columbia in 1939; initially he was rejected and then only accepted on a probationary basis. 41 He completed his Master of Arts degree in chemistry in 1941 and earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in chemistry in 1948. /ref> He wrote a dissertation on Kinetics of the Reaction Inactivation of During Its Catalysis of the Aerobic Oxidation of . ref> /ref> An abridged version was published in the ref> /ref> (February 1950, p. 820; online at the JACS website. ref> /ref> ).

Sprague de Camp , and Asimov (left to right), Philadelphia Navy Yard , 1944 From 1942 to 1945 during World War II , between his masters and doctoral studies, Asimov worked as a civilian chemist at the Philadelphia Navy Yard 's Naval Air Experimental Station and lived in the Walnut Hill section of West Philadelphia . 49 50 In September 1945, he was conscripted into the post-war U.S. Army ; if he had not had his birth date corrected while at school, he would have been officially 26 years old and ineligible. 51 In 1946, a bureaucratic error caused his military allotment to be stopped, and he was removed from a task force days before it sailed to participate in Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests at Bikini Atoll . 52 He was promoted to corporal on July 11 before receiving an honorable discharge on July 26, 1946. 53 /ref> , '> f After completing his doctorate and a postdoctoral year with Robert Elderfield , 55 Asimov was offered the position of associate professor of biochemistry at the Boston University School of Medicine . This was in large part due to his years-long correspondence with William Boyd , a former associate professor of biochemistry at Boston University, who initially contacted Asimov to compliment him on his story Nightfall . 56 Upon receiving a promotion to professor of immunochemistry , Boyd reached out to Asimov, requesting him to be his replacement. The initial offer of professorship was withdrawn and Asimov was offered the position of instructor of biochemistry instead, which he accepted. 57 He began work in 1949 with a $5,000 salary 58 ( equivalent to $66,000 in 2024 ), maintaining this position for several years. 59 By 1952, however, he was making more money as a writer than from the university, and he eventually stopped doing research, confining his university role to lecturing students. /ref> , '> g In 1955, he was promoted to tenured associate professor. In December 1957, Asimov was dismissed from his teaching post, with effect from June 30, 1958, due to his lack of research. After a struggle over two years, he reached an agreement with the university that he would keep his title 61 and give the opening lecture each year for a biochemistry class. 62 On October 18, 1979, the university honored his writing by promoting him to full professor of biochemistry. 63 Asimov's personal papers from 1965 onward are archived at the university's Mugar Memorial Library , to which he donated them at the request of curator Howard Gotlieb. 64 65 In 1959, after a recommendation from Arthur Obermayer , Asimov's friend and a scientist on the U.S. missile defense project, Asimov was approached by DARPA to join Obermayer's team. Asimov declined on the grounds that his ability to write freely would be impaired should he receive classified information , but submitted a paper to DARPA titled On Creativity 66 containing ideas on how government-based science projects could encourage team members to think more creatively. 67 Personal life Asimov met his first wife, Gertrude Blugerman, on a blind date on February 14, 1942, and married her on July 26. 68 The couple lived in an apartment in West Philadelphia while Asimov was employed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard (where two of his co-workers were L. Sprague de Camp and Robert A. Heinlein ). Gertrude returned to Brooklyn while he was in the Army, and they both lived there from July 1946 before moving to Stuyvesant Town , Manhattan , in July 1948. They moved to Boston in May 1949, then to nearby suburbs Somerville in July 1949, Waltham in May 1951, and, finally, West Newton in 1956. 69 They had two children, David (born 1951) and Robyn Joan (born 1955). 70 In 1970, they separated and Asimov moved back to New York, this time to the Upper West Side of Manhattan where he lived for the rest of his life. 71 He began seeing Janet O. Jeppson , a psychiatrist and science-fiction writer, and married her on November 30, 1973, 72 two weeks after his divorce from Gertrude. 73 Asimov was a claustrophile : he enjoyed small, enclosed spaces. 74 h In the third volume of his autobiography, he recalls a childhood desire to own a magazine stand in a New York City Subway station, within which he could enclose himself and listen to the rumble of passing trains while reading. 75 Asimov was afraid of flying , doing so only twice: once in the course of his work at the Naval Air Experimental Station and once returning home from Oʻahu in 1946. Consequently, he seldom traveled great distances. This phobia influenced several of his fiction works, such as the Wendell Urth mystery stories and the Robot novels featuring Elijah Baley . In his later years, Asimov found enjoyment traveling on cruise ships , beginning in 1972 when he viewed the Apollo 17 launch from a cruise ship . 76 On several cruises, he was part of the entertainment program, giving science-themed talks aboard ships such as the Queen Elizabeth 2 . 77 He sailed to England in June 1974 on the SS France for a trip mostly devoted to lectures in London and Birmingham, 78 though he also found time to visit Stonehenge 79 and Shakespeare's birthplace. 80 Asimov with his second wife, Janet. Sideburns became a permanent feature of my face, and it is now difficult to believe early photographs that show me without them . 81 (Photo by Jay Kay Klein.) Asimov was a teetotaler . 82 He was an able public speaker and was regularly invited to give talks about science in his distinct New York accent . He participated in many science fiction conventions , where he was friendly and approachable. 77 He patiently answered tens of thousands of questions and other mail with postcards and was pleased to give autographs. He was of medium height, 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) 83 and stocky build. In his later years, he adopted a signature style of mutton-chop sideburns . 84 85 He took to wearing bolo ties after his wife Janet objected to his clip-on bow ties. 86 He never learned to swim or ride a bicycle, but did learn to drive a car after he moved to Boston. In his humor book Asimov Laughs Again , he describes Boston driving as anarchy on wheels . 87 Asimov's wide interests included his participation in later years in organizations devoted to the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan . 77 Many of his short stories mention or quote Gilbert and Sullivan. 88 He was a prominent member of The Baker Street Irregulars , the leading Sherlock Holmes society, 77 for whom he wrote an essay arguing that Professor Moriarty's work The Dynamics of An Asteroid involved the willful destruction of an ancient, civilized planet. He was also a member of the male-only literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders , which served as the basis of his fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers . 89 He later used his essay on Moriarty's work as the basis for a Black Widowers story, The Ultimate Crime , which appeared in More Tales of the Black Widowers . 90 91 In 1984, the American Humanist Association (AHA) named him the Humanist of the Year. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto . 92 From 1985 until his death in 1992, he served as honorary president of the AHA, and was succeeded by his friend and fellow writer Kurt Vonnegut . He was also a close friend of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry , and earned a screen credit as special science consultant on Star Trek: The Motion Picture for his advice during production. 93 Asimov was a founding member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, CSICOP (now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry ) 94 and is listed in its Pantheon of Skeptics. 95 In a discussion with James Randi at CSICon 2016 regarding the founding of CSICOP, Kendrick Frazier said that Asimov was a key figure in the Skeptical movement who is less well known and appreciated today, but was very much in the public eye back then. He said that Asimov's being associated with CSICOP gave it immense status and authority in his eyes. 96 : 13:00 Asimov described Carl Sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own. The other, he claimed, was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Marvin Minsky . 97 Asimov was an on-and-off member and honorary vice president of Mensa International , albeit reluctantly; 98 he described some members of that organization as brain-proud and aggressive about their IQs . 99 Thinking About Thinking in Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction , January 1975. /ref> and I simply don t think it is reasonable to use IQ tests to produce results of questionable value, which may then serve to justify racists in their own minds and to help bring about the kinds of tragedies we have already witnessed earlier in this century. ref> Alas, All Human in Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction , June 1979. /ref> , '> i After his father died in 1969, Asimov annually contributed to a Judah Asimov Scholarship Fund at Brandeis University . 102 In 2006, he was named by Carnegie Corporation of New York to the inaugural class of winners of the Great Immigrants Award . 103 Illness and death In 1977, Asimov had a heart attack . In December 1983, he had triple bypass surgery at NYU Medical Center, during which he contracted HIV from a blood transfusion . 104 His HIV status was kept secret out of concern that the anti-AIDS prejudice might extend to his family members. 105 He died in Manhattan on April 6, 1992, 106 and was cremated. 107 The cause of death was reported as heart and kidney failure . 108 109 110 Ten years following Asimov's death, Janet and Robyn Asimov agreed that the HIV story should be made public; Janet revealed it in her edition of his autobiography, It's Been a Good Life . 104 110 105 Writings /ref> , ' /> T he only thing about myself that I consider to be severe enough to warrant psychoanalytic treatment is my compulsion to write ...

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of The Naked Sun (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called Biochemistry and Human Metabolism . Following the brief orbit of the first human-made satellite Sputnik I by the USSR in 1957, he wrote more nonfiction, particularly popular science books, and less science fiction. Over the next quarter-century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, and 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of Foundation's Edge . From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories. 112 Doubleday and Houghton Mifflin published about 60% of his work up to 1969, Asimov stating that both represent a father image . 62 Asimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his Three Laws of Robotics and the Foundation series . 113 The Oxford English Dictionary credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words robotics , positronic (an entirely fictional technology), and psychohistory (which is also used for a different study on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term robotics without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as mechanics and hydraulics , but for robots . Unlike his word psychohistory , the word robotics continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. Star Trek: The Next Generation featured androids with positronic brains and the first-season episode Datalore called the positronic brain Asimov's dream . 114 Asimov was so prolific and diverse in his writing that his books span all major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification except for category 100, philosophy and psychology . 115 However, he wrote several essays about psychology, 116 and forewords for the books The Humanist Way (1988) and In Pursuit of Truth (1982), 117 which were classified in the 100s category, but none of his own books were classified in that category. 115 According to UNESCO 's Index Translationum database , Asimov is the world's 24th-most-translated author. 118 Science fiction /ref> , ' /> No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified. — Asimov, 1980 119 The first installment of Asimov's Tyrann was the cover story in the fourth issue of Galaxy Science Fiction in 1951. The novel was issued in book form later that year as The Stars Like Dust . The first installment of Asimov's The Caves of Steel on the cover of the October 1953 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction , illustrated by Ed Emshwiller The novelette Legal Rites , a collaboration with Frederik Pohl , the only Asimov story to appear in Weird Tales Asimov became a science fiction fan in 1929, 120 when he began reading the pulp magazines sold in his family's candy store. 121 At first his father forbade reading pulps until Asimov persuaded him that because the science fiction magazines had Science in the title, they must be educational. 122 At age 18 he joined the Futurians science fiction fan club , where he made friends who went on to become science fiction writers or editors. 123 Asimov began writing at the age of 11, imitating The Rover Boys with eight chapters of The Greenville Chums at College . His father bought him a used typewriter at age 16. 62 His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School's literary journal in 1934. In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, Cosmic Corkscrew (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of Astounding Science Fiction , Asimov visited its publisher Street Smith Publications . Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938, and personally submitted it to Astounding editor John W. Campbell two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a detailed rejection letter. 120 This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949; 58 Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend. 124 By the end of the month, Asimov completed a second story, Stowaway . Campbell rejected it on July 22 but—in the nicest possible letter you could imagine —encouraged him to continue writing, promising that Asimov might sell his work after another year and a dozen stories of practice. 120 On October 21, 1938, he sold the third story he finished, Marooned Off Vesta , to Amazing Stories , edited by Raymond A. Palmer , and it appeared in the March 1939 issue. Asimov was paid $64 ( equivalent to $1,430 in 2024 ), or one cent a word. 62 125 Two more stories appeared that year, The Weapon Too Dreadful to Use in the May Amazing and Trends in the July Astounding , the issue fans later selected as the start of the Golden Age of Science Fiction . 16 For 1940, ISFDB catalogs seven stories in four different pulp magazines, including one in Astounding . 126 His earnings became enough to pay for his education, but not yet enough for him to become a full-time writer. 125 He later said that unlike other Golden Age writers Heinlein and A. E. van Vogt —also first published in 1939, and whose talent and stardom were immediately obvious—Asimov (this is not false modesty) came up only gradually . 16 Through July 29, 1940, Asimov wrote 22 stories in 25 months, of which 13 were published; he wrote in 1972 that from that date he never wrote a science fiction story that was not published (except for two special cases Asimov, The Early Asimov Frogmore, UK: Panther Books, pp. 147, 230. /ref> The latter was published in 1974. ref>Asimov, I. (1981). In Joy Still Felt. Avon Books. p. nbsp;582. /ref> , '> j ). 129 By 1941 Asimov was famous enough that Donald Wollheim told him that he purchased The Secret Sense for a new magazine only because of his name, 130 and the December 1940 issue of Astonishing —featuring Asimov's name in bold—was the first magazine to base cover art on his work, 131 but Asimov later said that neither he nor anyone else—except perhaps Campbell—considered him better than an often published third rater . 132 Based on a conversation with Campbell, Asimov wrote Nightfall , his 32nd story, in March and April 1941, and Astounding published it in September 1941. In 1968 the Science Fiction Writers of America voted Nightfall the best science fiction short story ever written. 108 132 In Nightfall and Other Stories Asimov wrote, The writing of 'Nightfall' was a watershed in my professional career ... I was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction became aware that I existed. As the years passed, in fact, it became evident that I had written a 'classic'. 133 Nightfall is an archetypal example of social science fiction , a term he created to describe a new trend in the 1940s, led by authors including him and Heinlein, away from gadgets and space opera and toward speculation about the human condition . 134 After writing Victory Unintentional in January and February 1942, Asimov did not write another story for a year. He expected to make chemistry his career, and was paid $2,600 annually at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, enough to marry his girlfriend; he did not expect to make much more from writing than the $1,788.50 he had earned from the 28 stories he had already sold over four years. Asimov left science fiction fandom and no longer read new magazines, and might have left the writing profession had not Heinlein and de Camp been his coworkers at the Navy Yard and previously sold stories continued to appear. 135 In 1942, Asimov published the first of his Foundation stories—later collected in the Foundation trilogy : Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952), and Second Foundation (1953). The books describe the fall of a vast interstellar empire and the establishment of its eventual successor. They feature his fictional science of psychohistory , whose theories could predict the future course of history according to dynamical laws regarding the statistical analysis of mass human actions. 136 Campbell raised his rate per word, Orson Welles purchased rights to Evidence , and anthologies reprinted his stories. By the end of the war Asimov was earning as a writer an amount equal to half of his Navy Yard salary, even after a raise, but Asimov still did not believe that writing could support him, his wife, and future children. 137 138 His positronic robot stories —many of which were collected in I, Robot (1950)—were begun at about the same time. They promulgated a set of rules of ethics for robots (see Three Laws of Robotics ) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject. Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection The Complete Robot (1982) that he was largely inspired by the tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a Frankenstein plot in which they destroyed their creators. The Robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, Harlan Ellison wrote a screenplay of I, Robot that Asimov hoped would lead to the first really adult, complex, worthwhile science fiction film ever made . The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994. The 2004 movie I, Robot , starring Will Smith , was based on an unrelated script by Jeff Vintar titled Hardwired , with Asimov's ideas incorporated later after the rights to Asimov's title were acquired. 139 (The title was not original to Asimov but had previously been used for a story by Eando Binder .) Also, one of Asimov's robot short stories, The Bicentennial Man , was expanded into a novel The Positronic Man by Asimov and Robert Silverberg , and this was adapted into the 1999 movie Bicentennial Man , starring Robin Williams . 93 In 1966 the Foundation trilogy won the Hugo Award for the all-time best series of science fiction and fantasy novels, 140 and they along with the Robot series are his most famous science fiction. Besides movies, his Foundation and Robot stories have inspired other derivative works of science fiction literature, many by well-known and established authors such as Roger MacBride Allen , Greg Bear , Gregory Benford , David Brin , and Donald Kingsbury . At least some of these appear to have been done with the blessing of, or at the request of, Asimov's widow, Janet Asimov . 141 142 143 In 1948, he also wrote a spoof chemistry article, The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline . At the time, Asimov was preparing his own doctoral dissertation , which would include an oral examination. Fearing a prejudicial reaction from his graduate school evaluation board at Columbia University , Asimov asked his editor that it be released under a pseudonym. When it nevertheless appeared under his own name, Asimov grew concerned that his doctoral examiners might think he wasn't taking science seriously. At the end of the examination, one evaluator turned to him, smiling, and said, What can you tell us, Mr. Asimov, about the thermodynamic properties of the compound known as thiotimoline . Laughing hysterically with relief, Asimov had to be led out of the room. After a five-minute wait, he was summoned back into the room and congratulated as Dr. Asimov . 144 Demand for science fiction greatly increased during the 1950s, making it possible for a genre author to write full-time. 145 In 1949, book publisher Doubleday 's science fiction editor Walter I. Bradbury accepted Asimov's unpublished Grow Old with Me (40,000 words), but requested that it be extended to a full novel of 70,000 words. The book appeared under the Doubleday imprint in January 1950 with the title of Pebble in the Sky . 58 Doubleday published five more original science fiction novels by Asimov in the 1950s, along with the six juvenile Lucky Starr novels , the latter under the pseudonym Paul French . 146 Doubleday also published collections of Asimov's short stories, beginning with The Martian Way and Other Stories in 1955. The early 1950s also saw Gnome Press publish one collection of Asimov's positronic robot stories as I, Robot and his Foundation stories and novelettes as the three books of the Foundation trilogy . More positronic robot stories were republished in book form as The Rest of the Robots . Book publishers and the magazines Galaxy and Fantasy Science Fiction ended Asimov's dependence on Astounding . He later described the era as his 'mature' period . Asimov's The Last Question (1956), on the ability of humankind to cope with and potentially reverse the process of entropy , was his personal favorite story. 147 In 1972, his stand-alone novel The Gods Themselves was published to general acclaim, winning Best Novel in the Hugo , 148 Nebula , 148 and Locus Awards. 149 In December 1974, former Beatle Paul McCartney approached Asimov and asked him to write the screenplay for a science-fiction movie musical. McCartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue, about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by extraterrestrials. The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group Wings , then at the height of their career. Though not generally a fan of rock music, Asimov was intrigued by the idea and quickly produced a treatment outline of the story adhering to McCartney's overall idea but omitting McCartney's scrap of dialogue. McCartney rejected it, and the treatment now exists only in the Boston University archives. 150 Asimov said in 1969 that he had the happiest of all my associations with science fiction magazines with Fantasy Science Fiction ; I have no complaints about Astounding , Galaxy , or any of the rest, heaven knows, but F SF has become something special to me . 151 Beginning in 1977, Asimov lent his name to Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine (now Asimov's Science Fiction ) and wrote an editorial for each issue. There was also a short-lived Asimov's SF Adventure Magazine and a companion Asimov's Science Fiction Anthology reprint series, published as magazines (in the same manner as the stablemates Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine ' s and Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine ' s anthologies ). 152 Due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another book in his Foundation series, 59 he did so with Foundation's Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1992), his last novel. He also helped Leonard Nimoy fleshing out the premise of the science fiction comic Primortals (1995–1997). 153 Popular science /ref> , ' /> Just say I am one of the most versatile writers in the world, and the greatest popularizer of many subjects. — Asimov, 1969 62 Asimov and two colleagues published a textbook in 1949, with two more editions by 1969. 62 During the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov substantially decreased his fiction output (he published only four adult novels between 1957's The Naked Sun and 1982's Foundation's Edge , two of which were mysteries). He greatly increased his nonfiction production, writing mostly on science topics; the launch of Sputnik in 1957 engendered public concern over a science gap . 154 Asimov explained in The Rest of the Robots that he had been unable to write substantial fiction since the summer of 1958, and observers understood him as saying that his fiction career had ended, or was permanently interrupted. 155 Asimov recalled in 1969 that the United States went into a kind of tizzy, and so did I. I was overcome by the ardent desire to write popular science for an America that might be in great danger through its neglect of science, and a number of publishers got an equally ardent desire to publish popular science for the same reason . 156 Fantasy and Scienc",
