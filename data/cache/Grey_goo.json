Self-replicating machines of the macroscopic variety were originally described by mathematician John von Neumann , and are sometimes referred to as von Neumann machines or clanking replicators . The term gray goo was coined by nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in his 1986 book Engines of Creation . 4 In 2004, he stated I wish I had never used the term 'gray goo'. 5 Engines of Creation mentions gray goo as a thought experiment in two paragraphs and a note, while the popularized idea of gray goo was first publicized in a mass-circulation magazine, Omni , in November 1986. 6 Definition The term was first used by molecular nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in Engines of Creation (1986). In Chapter 4, Engines Of Abundance , Drexler illustrates both exponential growth and inherent limits (not gray goo) by describing dry nanomachines that can function only if given special raw materials : Imagine such a replicator floating in a bottle of chemicals, making copies of itself...the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four, and the eight build another eight. At the end of ten hours, there are not thirty-six new replicators, but over 68 billion. In less than a day, they would weigh a ton; in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined — if the bottle of chemicals hadn't run dry long before. According to Drexler, the term was popularized by an article in science fiction magazine Omni , which also popularized the term nanotechnology in the same issue. Drexler says arms control is a far greater issue than gray goo nanobugs . 7 Drexler describes gray goo in Chapter 11 of Engines of Creation : Early assembler-based replicators could beat the most advanced modern organisms. 'Plants' with 'leaves' no more efficient than today's solar cells could out-compete real plants, crowding the biosphere with an inedible foliage. Tough, omnivorous 'bacteria' could out-compete real bacteria: they could spread like blowing pollen, replicate swiftly, and reduce the biosphere to dust in a matter of days. Dangerous replicators could easily be too tough, small, and rapidly spreading to stop — at least if we made no preparation. We have trouble enough controlling viruses and fruit flies. Drexler notes that the geometric growth made possible by self-replication is inherently limited by the availability of suitable raw materials. Drexler used the term gray goo not to indicate Eric Drexler (August 2004). Safe Exponential Manufacturing (PDF) . Nanotechnology . 15 (8): 869– 72. doi : 10.1088/0957-4484/15/8/001 .
