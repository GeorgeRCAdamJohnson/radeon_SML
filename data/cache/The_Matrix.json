[ a ] It is the first installment in the Matrix film series , starring Keanu Reeves , Laurence Fishburne , Carrie-Anne Moss , Hugo Weaving , and Joe Pantoliano . It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality created by intelligent machines . Believing computer hacker Neo to be \"the One\" prophesied to defeat them, Morpheus recruits him into a rebellion against the machines. Following the success of Bound (1996), Warner Bros. gave the go-ahead for The Matrix after the Wachowskis sent an edit of the film's opening minutes. Action scenes were influenced by anime and martial arts films , particularly fight choreography and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema . Other influences include Plato's cave and 1990s Telnet hacker communities. The film popularized terms such as the red pill , and popularised a visual effect known as \" bullet time \", in which a character's heightened perception is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The film was a box office success, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth-highest-grossing film of that year . The film received nominations at the 72nd Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects , Best Film Editing , Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing, winning all four categories. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards , and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the 26th Saturn Awards . The Matrix is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time, [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\". [ 11 ] The film's success led to two sequels by the Wachowskis, both released in 2003, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions . The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and an animated anthology film , The Animatrix , with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film, titled The Matrix Resurrections , directed solely by Lana Wachowski was released in 2021. Plot In 1999, in an unnamed city, Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer known as \" Neo \" in hacking circles, delves into the mystery of the \"Matrix\", bringing him to the attention of hacker Trinity . She tells him that the enigmatic Morpheus can answer Neo's questions. At his workplace, Neo is pursued by Agents led by Agent Smith , while Morpheus, able to somehow observe their movements, guides him by phone, but Neo ultimately surrenders. The Agents interrogate Neo about Morpheus, but he refuses to cooperate. In response, they seal his mouth shut and implant a robotic tracking device in his abdomen. Neo awakens at home, believing the encounter to have been a nightmare until Trinity and her allies remove the device and take him to Morpheus. Morpheus offers Neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the Matrix or a blue pill to return to his normal life. Taking the red pill, Neo awakens in the real world, submerged in a mechanical pod and connected to invasive cables. He sees countless humans similarly encased and tended by machines before being ejected from the structure and rescued by Morpheus aboard the hovercraft Nebuchadnezzar . Morpheus reveals that the year is approximately 2199. In the 21st century, humanity lost a war against its artificially intelligent creations, leaving Earth a devastated ruin. Humans blackened the sky to deprive the machines of solar power, but the machines retaliated by creating vast fields of artificially grown humans, harvesting their bioelectric energy. To keep their captives pacified, they built the Matrix, a simulated reality modeled on human civilization at its peak. The remaining free humans founded an underground refuge called Zion, surviving on scarce resources. Morpheus and his crew hack into the Matrix to liberate others, exploiting its rules to gain superhuman abilities within it. Even so, they remain outmatched by the Agents—sentient programs that protect the system—and death in the Matrix means death in the real world. Morpheus freed Neo because he believes him to be \"the One\", a prophesied figure destined to free humanity. The crew enter the Matrix to seek guidance from the Oracle , who foretold the coming of the One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns him of an imminent choice between his life and Morpheus's. The crew are ambushed by Agents after being betrayed by Cypher, a disillusioned crew member who longs to return to the virtual comforts of the Matrix. Convinced of Neo's importance, Morpheus sacrifices himself to confront Smith and is captured. Meanwhile, Cypher exits the Matrix and begins disconnecting the others, killing them. Before he can kill Neo and Trinity, Tank, a wounded crew member, regains consciousness, kills Cypher, and safely extracts the survivors. Smith interrogates Morpheus to obtain access codes for Zion's mainframe, which would enable the machines to destroy the human resistance. Determined to rescue him, Neo reenters the Matrix with Trinity. They free Morpheus, who escapes the Matrix with Trinity, but Smith intercepts Neo. Realizing his potential, Neo fights Smith as an equal and kills him. However, Smith resurrects in a new body and kills Neo. In the real world, machines called Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar . Standing by Neo's body, Trinity confesses her love for him and reveals that the Oracle prophesied she would fall in love with the One. In the Matrix, Neo revives with the ability to perceive and manipulate its code. He effortlessly destroys Smith and escapes the Matrix just as the Nebuchadnezzar ' s electromagnetic pulse disables the Sentinels. Later, within the Matrix, Neo communicates with the system, vowing to show humanity a world of limitless possibilities, before flying away.

Keanu Reeves as Neo : A computer programmer, born Thomas Anderson, who secretly operates as a hacker named Neo. Reeves described his character as someone who felt that something was wrong, and was searching for Morpheus and the truth to break free. [ 12 ] Will Smith turned down the role of Neo to make Wild Wild West , because of skepticism over the film's ambitious bullet time special effects. [ 13 ] He later stated he was \"not mature enough as an actor\" at that time, [ 13 ] and that if given the role, he \"would have messed it up\". [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Smith praised Reeves for his portrayal. [ 16 ] Nicolas Cage also turned down the part because of \"family obligations\". [ 17 ] Warner Bros. sought Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer for the role. [ 18 ] When both declined, Leonardo DiCaprio initially accepted the role, but ultimately turned it down because he did not want to do a visual effects film directly after Titanic . [ 19 ] The studio pushed for Reeves, who won the role over Johnny Depp , the Wachowskis' first choice. [ 18 ] Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated that the screenplay was also sent to Sandra Bullock , with the suggestion of rewriting Neo as a female. [ 19 ] Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus : A human freed from the Matrix and captain of the Nebuchadnezzar . Fishburne stated that once he read the script, he did not understand why other people found it confusing. However, he doubted if the movie would ever be made, because it was \"so smart\". [ 12 ] The Wachowskis instructed Fishburne to base his performance on the character Morpheus in Neil Gaiman 's Sandman comics. [ 20 ] Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity : A human freed by Morpheus, a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar , and later Neo's romantic interest. After reading the script, Moss stated that at first, she did not believe she had to do the extreme acrobatic actions as described in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why some people would trust them. [ 12 ] Moss mentioned that she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting, so she knew what to expect subsequently. [ 21 ] The role made Moss, who later said, \"I had no career before. None.\" [ 22 ] Janet Jackson was initially approached for the role but scheduling conflicts prevented her from accepting it. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In an interview, she stated that turning down the role was difficult for her, so she later referenced The Matrix in the 'Intro' and 'Outro' interludes on her tenth studio album Discipline . [ 25 ] Sandra Bullock , who was previously approached for the role of Neo, was also offered the role of Trinity, but she turned it down. [ 26 ] Rosie Perez , Salma Hayek and Jada Pinkett Smith (who would later play Niobe in the sequels) auditioned for the role. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith : A sentient \"Agent\" program of the Matrix whose purpose is to destroy Zion and stop humans from getting out of the Matrix. Unlike other Agents, he has ambitions to free himself from his duties. Weaving stated that he found the character amusing and enjoyable to play. He developed a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither robotic nor human, and also said that the Wachowskis' voices had influenced his voice in the film. When filming began, Weaving mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend him. [ 30 ] Jean Reno was offered the role, but declined, unwilling to move to Australia for the production. [ 31 ] Gloria Foster as The Oracle : A prophet who still resides in the Matrix, helping the freed humans with her foresight and wisdom. Joe Pantoliano as Cypher: Another human freed by Morpheus, and a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar , but one who regrets taking the red pill and seeks to be returned to the Matrix, later betraying the rebels to Agent Smith. Pantoliano had worked with the Wachowskis prior to appearing in The Matrix , starring in their 1996 film Bound . Marcus Chong as Tank: The \"operator\" of the Nebuchadnezzar and Dozer's brother; they are both \"natural\" (as opposed to bred) humans, born outside of the Matrix. Paul Goddard as Agent Brown: One of two sentient \"Agent\" programs in the Matrix, who works with Agent Smith to destroy Zion and stop humans from escaping the system. Robert Taylor as Agent Jones: One of two sentient \"Agent\" programs in the Matrix who works with Agent Smith to destroy Zion and stop humans from escaping the system. Julian Arahanga as Apoc: A freed human and a crew member on the Nebuchadnezzar . Matt Doran as Mouse: A freed human and a programmer on the Nebuchadnezzar . Belinda McClory as Switch: A human freed by Morpheus, and a crew member of the Nebuchadnezzar . Anthony Ray Parker as Dozer: Pilot of the Nebuchadnezzar . He is Tank's brother, and like him was born outside of the Matrix. Rowan Witt as The Spoon Boy, a young prophet who has learnt how to manipulate the world of the Matrix. Seemingly wise beyond his years, he teaches Neo how to develop his powers and provides him with wisdom and motivation across the films and graphic novels. Ada Nicodemou as DuJour: A reference to the White Rabbit in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland . Production Development In 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film Assassins to Warner Bros. Pictures . After Lorenzo di Bonaventura , the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, Bound and The Matrix , in the contract. The first movie the Wachowskis directed, Bound , then became a critical success. Using this momentum, they later asked to direct The Matrix . [ 32 ] Reeves said that the Matrix avatar would have been a \"different sex than the Zion reality\" in the early draft of the script, but the studio was not ready for that version. [ 33 ] In 1996, the Wachowskis pitched the role of Neo to Will Smith . Smith explained on his YouTube channel that the idea was for him to be Neo, while Morpheus was to be played by Val Kilmer . He later explained that he did not quite understand the concept and he turned down the role to instead film Wild Wild West . [ 34 ] Madonna also turned down an undisclosed role, a decision she would later regret. [ 35 ] Producer Joel Silver soon joined the project. Although the project had key supporters, including Silver and Di Bonaventura, to influence the company, The Matrix was still a huge investment for Warner Bros., which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with prominent actors and difficult special effects. [ 32 ] The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget. [ 32 ] Soon, The Matrix became a co-production of Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures . [ 39 ] According to editor Zach Staenberg on the DVD audio commentary track, the production team sent an edit of the film's first minutes (featuring Trinity's encounter with police and Agents) to Warner Bros. executives, and secured Warner Bros.' \"total support of the movie\" from then on. [ 40 ] Pre-production The cast were required to be able to understand and explain The Matrix . [ 32 ] French philosopher Jean Baudrillard 's Simulacra and Simulation was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew. [ 41 ] In early 1997, the Wachowskis had Reeves and Moss read Simulacra and Simulation , Kevin Kelly 's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World , and Dylan Evans 's ideas on evolutionary psychology even before they opened up the script. [ 12 ] Eventually, Reeves was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved. [ 32 ] Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process. [ 12 ] The directors had long been admirers of Hong Kong action cinema , so they decided to hire the Chinese martial arts choreographer and film director Yuen Woo-ping to work on fight scenes. To prepare for the wire fu , the actors had to train hard for several months. [ 32 ] The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training, beginning in October 1997. [ 42 ] Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were. [ 21 ] Yuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actor's strength. He built on Reeves's diligence, Fishburne's resilience, Weaving's precision and Moss's grace. [ 21 ] Yuen designed Moss's moves to suit her deftness and lightness. [ 43 ] Prior to the pre-production, Reeves underwent a two-level fusion of his cervical (neck) spine due to spinal cord compression from a herniated disc (\"I was falling over in the shower in the morning\"). [ 44 ] He was still recovering by the time of pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film. [ 21 ] [ 45 ] Weaving had to undergo hip surgery after he sustained an injury during the training process. [ 32 ] Filming Campbell Street train bridge at the intersection of Elizabeth Street was one of the filming locations in the city of Sydney. All but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, as well as in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included to maintain the impression of a generic American city. The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Filming began in March 1998 and wrapped in August 1998; principal photography took 118 days. [ 48 ] Some filming also occurred at Culver Studios . [ 49 ] Due to Reeves's neck injury (see above), some of the action scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery. As a result, the filming began with scenes that did not require much physical exertion, [ 50 ] [ 51 ] such as the scene in Thomas Anderson's office, the interrogation room, [ 30 ] or the car ride in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle. [ 52 ] Locations for these scenes included Martin Place's fountain in Sydney, halfway between it and the adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself. [ 53 ] During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work. The bullet-time fight scene was filmed on the roof of Symantec Corporation building in Kent Street, opposite Sussex Street . [ 54 ] Moss performed the shots featuring Trinity at the beginning of the film and all the wire stunts herself. [ 43 ] The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of Dark City , which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films. [ 55 ] During the rehearsal of the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it. [ 56 ] The dojo set was built well before the actual filming. During the filming of these action sequences, there was significant physical contact between the actors, earning them bruises. Reeves's injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to filming meant he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself, causing the scene to be postponed. The scene was shot successfully a few days later, with Reeves using only three takes. Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene, creating a training feel. [ 57 ] The filmmakers originally planned to shoot the subway scene in an actual subway station , but the complexity of the fight and related wire work required shooting the scene on a set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, Chad Stahelski , Reeves's stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs , knees and a dislocated shoulder . Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot in which Neo was slammed into a booth. [ 58 ] The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the outside view from inside the building was a large, three story high cyclorama . The helicopter was a full-scale, light-weight mock-up suspended by a wire rope operated a tilting mechanism mounted to the studio roofbeams. The helicopter had a real minigun side-mounted to it, which was set to cycle at half its regular (3,000 rounds per minute) firing rate. [ 59 ] To prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod, Reeves lost 15 pounds (7 kg) and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look. The scene in which Neo fell into the sewer system concluded the principal photography. [ 48 ] According to The Art of the Matrix , at least one filmed scene and a variety of short pieces of action were omitted from the final cut of the film. [ 60 ] Sound effects and music See also: The Matrix: Original Motion Picture Score and The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture Dane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film. The fight scene sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, were created using thin metal rods and recording them, then editing the sounds. The sound of the pod containing a human body closing required almost fifty sounds put together. [ 61 ] The film's score , The Matrix: Original Motion Picture Score , was composed by Don Davis . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene. [ 64 ] In addition to Davis' score, The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture also features music from acts such as Rammstein , Rob Dougan , Rage Against the Machine , Propellerheads , Ministry , Lunatic Calm , Deftones , Monster Magnet , The Prodigy , Rob Zombie , Meat Beat Manifesto and Marilyn Manson . [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Production design See also: Matrix digital rain In the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters. [ 68 ] This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, [ 39 ] which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and Arabic numerals. [ 69 ] In a 2017 interview at CNET , he attributed the design to his wife, who is from Japan, and added, \"I like to tell everybody that The Matrix's code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes\". [ 70 ] \"The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors \". [ 71 ] Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic , supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall. [ 39 ] The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, Ghost in the Shell , which had a strong influence on the Matrix series. It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game The Matrix: Path of Neo , and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the Matrix series. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence. [ 39 ] The Matrix ' s production designer , Owen Paterson , used methods to distinguish the \"real world\" and the Matrix in a pervasive way. The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code's distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the \"real world\". In addition, the Matrix scenes' sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment. For the \"real world\", the actors' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors. [ 69 ] The Nebuchadnezzar was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on productions such as Star Trek . The wires were made visible to show the ship's working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as \"a marriage between Man and Machine\". [ 72 ] For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used and sinister. During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester suffered hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated. [ 48 ] Kym Barrett , costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume. [ 73 ] For example, Reeves's office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled and out of place. [ 50 ] Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider the practicality of the acting. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their clothing, and be able to work the wires while strapped into the harnesses. [ 73 ] For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbed and reflected different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity's costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character. [ 43 ] For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film JFK and classic men in black . [ 30 ] The sunglasses, a staple of the film's aesthetics, were commissioned for the film by designer Richard Walker from sunglasses maker Blinde Design. [ 74 ] Visual effects The \" bullet time \" effect was created for the film. A scene would be computer-modeled to decide the positioning of the physical cameras. The actor then provided their performance in a chroma key setup, while the cameras were fired in rapid succession, with fractions of a second delay between each shot. The result was combined with CGI backgrounds to create the final effect at (0:33). {{Cite journal |date=February 2006 |title=200 Things That Rocked Our World: Bullet Time |journal=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |issue=200 |page=136}}&lt;/ref>\"}},\"i\":0}}]}' id=\"mwAuw\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;margin-top:0}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{padding-left:1.6em}} As for artistic inspiration for bullet time, I would credit Otomo Katsuhiro , who co-wrote and directed Akira , which definitely blew me away, along with director Michel Gondry . His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view-morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects. Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion, and we were also able to create slow-motion events that 'virtual cameras' could move around—rather than the static action in Gondry's music videos with limited camera moves. — John Gaeta [ 75 ] The film is known for popularizing a visual effect [ 76 ] known as \" bullet time \", which allows a shot to progress in slow motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Bullet time has been described as \"a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix\", [ 79 ] and throughout the film, the effect is used to illustrate characters' exertion of control over time and space. [ 80 ] The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects, and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film. When John Gaeta read the script, he pleaded with an effects producer at Mass.Illusion to let him work on the project, and created a prototype that led to him becoming the film's visual effects supervisor. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] The method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera captures a still picture, contributing one frame to the video sequence, which creates the effect of \"virtual camera movement\"; the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time. [ 77 ] The bullet time effect is similar but slightly more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so that rather than appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion. [ 75 ] [ 81 ] The cameras' positions and exposures were previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect. [ 77 ] When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a frame frequency of 12,000 per second, as opposed to the normal 24 frames per second of film. [ 32 ] Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side. [ 77 ] To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture. [ citation needed ] The photo-realistic surroundings generated by this method were incorporated into the bullet time scene, [ 81 ] and algorithms based on optical flow were used to interpolate between the still images to produce a fluent dynamic motion; [ 83 ] [ 84 ] the computer-generated \"lead in\" and \"lead out\" slides were filled in between frames in sequence to get an illusion of orbiting the scene. [ 85 ] Manex Visual Effects used a cluster farm running the Unix-like operating system FreeBSD to render many of the film's visual effects. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] Manex also handled creature effects, such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass. [ 88 ] The photogrammetric and image-based computer-generated background approaches in The Matrix ' s bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions . The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters' motions and expressions. It also led to the development of \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras. [ 81 ] Release Home media The Matrix was released on DVD and Laserdisc in its original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 on September 21, 1999, in the US from Warner Home Video as well as in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in Hong Kong from ERA Home Entertainment. It was also released on VHS in both full screen and widescreen formats on December 7 , 1999. [ 5 ] After its DVD release, it was the first DVD to sell more than one million copies in the US. [ 89 ] By 2000, the film went on to become the first to sell more than three million copies in the US. [ 32 ] At that point, it became the top-selling DVD release of all time, holding this record for a few months before being surpassed by Gladiator . [ 90 ] By November 10 , 2003, one month after The Matrix Reloaded DVD was released, the sales of The Matrix DVD had exceeded 30 million copies. [ 91 ] It then debuted on both VHS and DVD formats in the UK on November 29 , 1999. The Matrix sold more than 107,000 DVD copies in just two weeks, breaking Armageddon ' s record for being the country's best-selling DVD title. [ 92 ] The Ultimate Matrix Collection was released on HD DVD on May 22 , 2007, [ 89 ] and on Blu-ray on October 14 , 2008. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] The film was also released standalone in a 10th-anniversary edition Blu-ray in the Digibook format on March 31 , 2009, ten years to the day after the film was released theatrically. [ 95 ] In 2010, the film had another DVD release along with the two sequels as The Complete Matrix Trilogy . It was also released on 4K HDR Blu-ray on May 22, 2018. [ 96 ] The film as part of The Matrix Trilogy was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 30, 2018. [ 97 ] Other media The franchise also contains four video games: Enter the Matrix (2003), which contains footage shot specifically for the game and chronicles events taking place before and during The Matrix Reloaded ; [ 98 ] The Matrix Online (2004), an MMORPG which continued the story beyond The Matrix Revolutions ; [ 99 ] [ 100 ] The Matrix: Path of Neo (2005), which focuses on Neo's journey through the trilogy of films; [ 101 ] and The Matrix Awakens (2021), an interactive technology demonstration developed by Epic Games using Unreal Engine 5 . [ 102 ] The franchise also includes The Matrix Comics , a series of comics and short stories set in the world of The Matrix , written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the official Matrix website; [ 103 ] they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printed trade paperback volumes, called The Matrix Comics, Vol 1 and Vol 2 . [ 104 ] Reception Box office The Matrix grossed $27.8 million during its opening weekend, as well as earning $37.4 million in its first five days. [ 105 ] It surpassed Lost in Space and Indecent Proposal simultaneously for having the biggest April and Easter opening weekends. [ 105 ] The film also had the second-highest opening weekend for a spring starter film, trailing behind Liar Liar . [ 105 ] Three years later in 2002, The Matrix ' s records for having the largest April and Easter opening weekends would be taken by The Scorpion King and Panic Room respectively. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Upon its opening, it had the highest opening weekend of any 1999 film, easily topping Payback . [ 105 ] Additionally, this was the biggest opening weekend for a Keanu Reeves film since Speed in 1994. [ 108 ] It would go on to rank number one at the box office during its first weekend, beating out Forces of Nature , 10 Things I Hate About You , The Out-of-Towners , Analyze This and EDtv . [ 105 ] The film would remain at the top of the box office for two weeks until it was overtaken by Life . [ 109 ] During its fourth weekend, The Matrix briefly returned to the number one spot. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] The following week, the film would be displaced by Entrapment . [ 112 ] In the UK, The Matrix earned $4.9 million in its first three days, ranking it as the third-highest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film, behind Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin , while also delivering the third-highest opening weekend of the year, after A Bug's Life and Notting Hill . [ 113 ] The film grossed $1.8 million in Taiwan, making the third-highest opening there, behind Armageddon and The Lost World: Jurassic Park . [ 113 ] Additionally, it managed to surpass Lethal Weapon 4 for having the market's highest opening for Warner Bros. [ 113 ] It also surpassed Eraser to secure the distributor's highest opening weekend in Germany, collecting $592,000. [ 113 ] In its original run, the film earned $171,479,930 (37.0%) in the United States and Canada and $292,037,453 (63.0%) in other countries, for a worldwide total of $463,517,383. [ 5 ] In North America , it went on to become the fifth highest-grossing film of 1999 and the highest-grossing R-rated film of that year. Worldwide, it was the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year, after Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace , The Sixth Sense and Toy Story 2 . [ 5 ] The Matrix became the second-highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time, behind Twister . [ 114 ] Overall, it was the third-highest-grossing R-rated film at the time, just after Saving Private Ryan and Terminator 2: Judgment Day . [ 114 ] Following re-releases, the worldwide gross of the film is $466,621,824. [ 5 ] In 2012, it was placed 122nd on the list of highest-grossing films of all time, and the second-highest-grossing film in the Matrix franchise after The Matrix Reloaded ($742.1 million). [ 5 ] Critical response The Matrix was praised by many critics, as well as filmmakers, and authors of science fiction, [ 7 ] especially for its \"spectacular action\" scenes and its \"groundbreaking special effects\". Some have described The Matrix as one of the best science fiction films of all time; [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Entertainment Weekly called The Matrix \"the most influential action movie of the generation\". [ 22 ] There have also been those, including philosopher William Irwin , who have suggested that the film explores significant philosophical and spiritual themes. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 210 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to the Wachowskis' imaginative vision, The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects\". [ 6 ] At Metacritic , which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received a score of 73 based on 35 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". [ 7 ] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale. [ 115 ] It ranked 323rd among critics, and 546th among directors, in the 2012 Sight &amp; Sound polls of the greatest films ever made . [ 116 ] Philip Strick commented in Sight &amp; Sound , if the Wachowskis \"claim no originality of message, they are startling innovators of method,\" praising the film's details and its \"broadside of astonishing images\". [ 117 ] Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four: he praised the film's visuals and premise, but disliked the third act 's focus on action. [ 118 ] Similarly, Time Out praised the \"entertainingly ingenious\" switches between different realities, Hugo Weaving 's \"engagingly odd\" performance, and the film's cinematography and production design, but concluded, \"the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic ... yet another slice of overlong, high-concept hokum.\" [ 119 ] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader reviewed the film negatively, criticizing it as \"simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour, until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources ... There's not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome.\" [ 120 ] Ian Nathan of Empire described Carrie-Anne Moss as \"a major find\", praised the \"surreal visual highs\" enabled by the bullet time (or \"flo-mo\") effect, and described the film as \"technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool\". Nathan remarked that although the film's \"looney plot\" would not stand up to scrutiny, that was not a big flaw because \" The Matrix is about pure experience\". [ 121 ] Maitland McDonagh said in her review for TV Guide , the Wachowskis' \"through-the-looking-glass plot... manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels: as a dystopian sci-fi thriller, as a brilliant excuse for the film's lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes, and as a pretty compelling call to the dead-above-the-eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains... This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits.\" [ 122 ] Salon ' s reviewer Andrew O'Hehir acknowledged that although The Matrix is in his view a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film (\"It lacks anything like adult emotion... all this pseudo-spiritual hokum, along with the over-ramped onslaught of special effects—some of them quite amazing—will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture, not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside\"), he concluded, \"as in Bound , there's an appealing scope and daring to the Wachowskis' work, and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense, this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction, but their passion for movies —for making them, watching them, inhabiting their world—is pure and deep.\" [ 123 ] Filmmakers and science fiction creators alike generally took a complimentary perspective of The Matrix . William Gibson , a key figure in cyberpunk fiction, called the film \"an innocent delight I hadn't felt in a long time\", and stated, \"Neo is my favourite-ever science fiction hero, absolutely.\" [ 124 ] Joss Whedon called the film \"my number one\" and praised its storytelling, structure and depth, concluding, \"It works on whatever level you want to bring to it\". [ 125 ] Darren Aronofsky commented, \"I walked out of The Matrix ... and I was thinking, 'What kind of science fiction movie can people make now?' The Wachowskis basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured.\" [ 126 ] M. Night Shyamalan expressed admiration for the Wachowskis, stating, \"Whatever you think of The Matrix , every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!\". [ 127 ] Simon Pegg said that The Matrix provided \"the excitement and satisfaction that The Phantom Menace failed to inspire. The Matrix seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen.\" [ 128 ] Quentin Tarantino counted The Matrix as one of his twenty favorite movies from 1992 to 2009. [ 129 ] James Cameron called it \"one of the most profoundly fresh science fiction films ev",
