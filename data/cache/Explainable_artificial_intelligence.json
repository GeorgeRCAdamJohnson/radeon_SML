Black-box models, on the other hand, are extremely hard to explain and may not be understood even by domain experts. 14 XAI algorithms follow the three principles of transparency, interpretability, and explainability. A model is transparent if the processes that extract model parameters from training data and generate labels from testing data can be described and motivated by the approach designer. 15 Interpretability describes the possibility of comprehending the ML model and presenting the underlying basis for decision-making in a way that is understandable to humans. 16 17 18 Explainability is a concept that is recognized as important, but a consensus definition is not yet available; 15 one possibility is the collection of features of the interpretable domain that have contributed, for a given example, to producing a decision (e.g., classification or regression) . 19 In summary, Interpretability refers to the user's ability to understand model outputs, while Model Transparency includes Simulatability (reproducibility of predictions), Decomposability (intuitive explanations for parameters), and Algorithmic Transparency (explaining how algorithms work). Model Functionality focuses on textual descriptions, visualization, and local explanations, which clarify specific outputs or instances rather than entire models. All these concepts aim to enhance the comprehensibility and usability of AI systems. 20 If algorithms fulfill these principles, they provide a basis for justifying decisions, tracking them and thereby verifying them, improving the algorithms, and exploring new facts. 21 Sometimes it is also possible to achieve a high-accuracy result with white-box ML algorithms. These algorithms have an interpretable structure that can be used to explain predictions. 22 Concept Bottleneck Models, which use concept-level abstractions to explain model reasoning, are examples of this and can be applied in both image 23 and text 24 prediction tasks. This is especially important in domains like medicine , defense , finance , and law , where it is crucial to understand decisions and build trust in the algorithms. 11 Many researchers argue that, at least for supervised machine learning , the way forward is symbolic regression , where the algorithm searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset. 25 26 27 AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command maximize the accuracy of assessing how positive film reviews are in the test dataset. The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as reviews containing the word horrible are likely to be negative. However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as reviews containing ' Daniel Day-Lewis ' are usually positive ; such rules may be undesirable if they are likely to fail to generalize outside the training set, or if people consider the rule to be cheating or unfair. A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea of how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test set. 28 Goals Cooperation between agents – in this case, algorithms and humans – depends on trust. If humans are to accept algorithmic prescriptions, they need to trust them. Incompleteness in formal trust criteria is a barrier to optimization. Transparency, interpretability, and explainability are intermediate goals on the road to these more comprehensive trust criteria. 29 This is particularly relevant in medicine, 30 especially with clinical decision support systems (CDSS), in which medical professionals should be able to understand how and why a machine-based decision was made in order to trust the decision and augment their decision-making process. 31 AI systems sometimes learn undesirable tricks that do an optimal job of satisfying explicit pre-programmed goals on the training data but do not reflect the more nuanced implicit desires of the human system designers or the full complexity of the domain data. For example, a 2017 system tasked with image recognition learned to cheat by looking for a copyright tag that happened to be associated with horse pictures rather than learning how to tell if a horse was actually pictured. 7 In another 2017 system, a supervised learning AI tasked with grasping items in a virtual world learned to cheat by placing its manipulator between the object and the viewer in a way such that it falsely appeared to be grasping the object. 32 33 One transparency project, the DARPA XAI program, aims to produce glass box models that are explainable to a human-in-the-loop without greatly sacrificing AI performance. Human users of such a system can understand the AI's cognition (both in real-time and after the fact) and can determine whether to trust the AI. 34 Other applications of XAI are knowledge extraction from black-box models and model comparisons. 35 In the context of monitoring systems for ethical and socio-legal compliance, the term glass box is commonly used to refer to tools that track the inputs and outputs of the system in question, and provide value-based explanations for their behavior. These tools aim to ensure that the system operates in accordance with ethical and legal standards, and that its decision-making processes are transparent and accountable. The term glass box is often used in contrast to black box systems, which lack transparency and can be more difficult to monitor and regulate. 36 The term is also used to name a voice assistant that produces counterfactual statements as explanations. 37 Explainability and interpretability techniques There is a subtle difference between the terms explainability and interpretability in the context of AI. 38 Term Definition Source Interpretability level of understanding how the underlying (AI) technology works ISO/IEC TR 29119-11:2020(en), 3.1.42 39 Explainability level of understanding how the AI-based system ... came up with a given result ISO/IEC TR 29119-11:2020(en), 3.1.31 39 Some explainability techniques don't involve understanding how the model works, and may work across various AI systems. Treating the model as a black box and analyzing how in this case, those who could potentially game the system are the criminals subject to the system's decisions. In this study, developers of the system discussed the issue of criminal gangs looking to illegally obtain passports, and they expressed concerns that, if given an idea of what factors might trigger an alert in the passport application process, those gangs would be able to send guinea pigs to test those triggers, eventually finding a loophole that would allow them to reliably get passports from under the noses of the authorities . 96 Adaptive integration and explanation Many approaches that it uses provides explanation in general, it doesn't take account for the diverse instead of rigidly adhering to a set of rules, humans are able to consider exceptional cases as well as appeals to their initial decision. 99 For such decisions, explainability will not necessarily cause end users to accept the use of decision-making algorithms. We will need to either turn to another method to increase trust and acceptance of decision-making algorithms, or question the need to rely solely on AI for such impactful decisions in the first place. However, some emphasize that the purpose of explainability of artificial intelligence is not to merely increase users' trust in the system's decisions, but to calibrate the users' level of trust to the correct level. 100 According to this principle, too much or too little user trust in the AI system will harm the overall performance of the human-system unit. When the trust is excessive, the users are not critical of possible mistakes of the system and when the users do not have enough trust in the system, they will not exhaust the benefits inherent in it. Criticism Some scholars have suggested that explainability in AI should be considered a goal secondary to AI effectiveness, and that encouraging the exclusive development of XAI may limit the functionality of AI more broadly. 101 102 Critiques of XAI rely on developed concepts of mechanistic and empiric reasoning from evidence-based medicine to suggest that AI technologies can be clinically validated even when their function cannot be understood by their operators. 101 Some researchers advocate the use of inherently interpretable machine learning models, rather than using post-hoc explanations in which a second model is created to explain the first. This is partly because post-hoc models increase the complexity in a decision pathway and partly because it is often unclear how faithfully a post-hoc explanation can mimic the computations of an entirely separate model. 22 However, another view is that what is important is that the explanation accomplishes the given task at hand, and whether it is pre or post-hoc doesn't matter. If a post-hoc explanation method helps a doctor diagnose cancer better, it is of secondary importance whether it is a correct/incorrect explanation. The goals of XAI amount to a form of lossy compression that will become less effective as AI models grow in their number of parameters. Along with other factors this leads to a theoretical limit for explainability. 103 Explainability in social choice Explainability was studied also in social choice theory . Social choice theory aims at finding solutions to social decision problems, that are based on well-established axioms. Ariel D. Procaccia 104 explains that these axioms can be used to construct convincing explanations to the solutions. This principle has been used to construct explanations in various subfields of social choice. Voting Cailloux and Endriss 105 present a method for explaining voting rules using the axioms that characterize them. They exemplify their method on the Borda voting rule . Peters, Procaccia, Psomas and Zhou 106 present an algorithm for explaining the outcomes of the Borda rule using O( m 2 ) explanations, and prove that this is tight in the worst case. Participatory budgeting Yang, Hausladen, Peters, Pournaras, Fricker and Helbing 107 present an empirical study of explainability in participatory budgeting . They compared the greedy and the equal shares rules, and three types of explanations: mechanism explanation (a general explanation of how the aggregation rule works given the voting input), individual explanation (explaining how many voters had at least one approved project, at least 10000 CHF in approved projects), and group explanation (explaining how the budget is distributed among the districts and topics). They compared the perceived trustworthiness and fairness of greedy and equal shares, before and after the explanations. They found out that, for MES, mechanism explanation yields the highest increase in perceived fairness and trustworthiness; the second-highest was Group explanation. For Greedy, Mechanism explanation increases perceived trustworthiness but not fairness, whereas Individual explanation increases both perceived fairness and trustworthiness. Group explanation decreases the perceived fairness and trustworthiness. Payoff allocation Nizri, Azaria and Hazon 108 present an algorithm for computing explanations for the Shapley value . Given a coalitional game, their algorithm decomposes it to sub-games, for which it is easy to generate verbal explanations based on the axioms characterizing the Shapley value. The payoff allocation for each sub-game is perceived as fair, so the Shapley-based payoff allocation for the given game should seem fair as well. An experiment with 210 human subjects shows that, with their automatically generated explanations, subjects perceive Shapley-based payoff allocation as significantly fairer than with a general standard explanation.
