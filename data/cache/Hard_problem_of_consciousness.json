  "content": "Hard problem of consciousness Philosophical concept In the philosophy of mind , the hard problem of consciousness is to explain why and how humans (and other organisms) have qualia , phenomenal consciousness , or subjective experience . 1 2 It is contrasted with the easy problems of explaining why and how physical systems give a human being the ability to discriminate, to integrate information, and to perform behavioural functions such as watching, listening, speaking (including generating an utterance that appears to refer to personal behaviour or belief), and so forth. 1 The easy problems are amenable to functional explanation—that is, explanations that are mechanistic or behavioural—since each physical system can be explained purely by reference to the structure and dynamics that underpin the phenomenon. 1 3 Proponents of the hard problem propose that it is categorically different from the easy problems since no mechanistic or behavioural explanation could explain the character of an experience , not even in principle. Even after all the relevant functional facts are explicated, they argue, there will still remain a further question: why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience? 1 To bolster their case, proponents of the hard problem frequently turn to various philosophical thought experiments , involving philosophical zombies , or inverted qualia , or the ineffability of colour experiences , or the unknowability of foreign states of consciousness, such as the experience of being a bat . David Chalmers on stage for an Alan Turing Year event at De La Salle University , Manila, 27 March 2012 The terms hard problem and easy problems were coined by the philosopher David Chalmers in a 1994 talk given at The Science of Consciousness conference held in Tucson, Arizona. 4 The following year, the main talking points of Chalmers' talk were published in The Journal of Consciousness Studies . 1 The publication gained significant attention from consciousness researchers and became the subject of a special volume of the journal, 5 6 which was later published into a book. 7 In 1996, Chalmers published The Conscious Mind , a book-length treatment of the hard problem, in which he elaborated on his core arguments and responded to counterarguments . His use of the word easy is tongue-in-cheek . 8 As the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker puts it, they are about as easy as going to Mars or curing cancer. That is, scientists more or less know what to look for, and with enough brainpower and funding, they would probably crack it in this century. 9 The existence of the hard problem is disputed. It has been accepted by some philosophers of mind such as Joseph Levine , 10 Colin McGinn , 11 and Ned Block 12 and cognitive neuroscientists such as Francisco Varela , 13 Giulio Tononi , 14 15 and Christof Koch . 14 15 On the other hand, its existence is rejected by other philosophers of mind, such as Daniel Dennett , 16 Massimo Pigliucci , 17 Thomas Metzinger , Patricia Churchland , 18 and Keith Frankish , 19 and by cognitive neuroscientists such as Stanislas Dehaene , 20 Bernard Baars , 21 Anil Seth , 22 and Antonio Damasio . 23 Clinical neurologist and sceptic Steven Novella has dismissed it as the hard non-problem . 24 According to a 2020 PhilPapers survey, a majority (62.42%) of the philosophers surveyed said they believed that the hard problem is a genuine problem, while 29.72% said that it does not exist. 25 There are a number of other potential philosophical problems that are related to the Hard Problem. Ned Block believes that there exists a Harder Problem of Consciousness , due to the possibility of different physical and functional neurological systems potentially having phenomenal overlap. 12 Another potential philosophical problem which is closely related to Benj Hellie's vertiginous question 26 , dubbed The Even Harder Problem of Consciousness , refers to why a given individual has their own particular personal identity , as opposed to existing as someone else. 27 Overview Cognitive scientist David Chalmers first formulated the hard problem in his paper Facing up to the problem of consciousness (1995) 1 and expanded upon it in The Conscious Mind (1996). His works provoked comment. Some, such as philosopher David Lewis and Steven Pinker, have praised Chalmers for his argumentative rigour and impeccable clarity . 28 Pinker later said, in 2018, In the end I still think that the hard problem is a meaningful conceptual problem, but agree with Dennett that it is not a meaningful scientific problem. No one will ever get a grant to study whether you are a zombie or whether the same Captain Kirk walks on the deck of the Enterprise and the surface of Zakdorn. And I agree with several other philosophers that it may be futile to hope for a solution at all, precisely because it is a conceptual problem, or, more accurately, a problem with our concepts. 29 Daniel Dennett and Patricia Churchland , among others, believe that the hard problem is best seen as a collection of easy problems that will be solved through further analysis of the brain and behaviour. 30 31 Consciousness is an ambiguous term. It can be used to mean self consciousness, awareness, the state of being awake, and so on. Chalmers uses Thomas Nagel 's definition of consciousness: the feeling of what it is like to be something. Consciousness, in this sense, is synonymous with experience. 32 28 Chalmers' formulation . . .even when we have explained the performance of all the cognitive and behavioral functions in the vicinity of experience—perceptual discrimination, categorization, internal access, verbal report—there may still remain a further unanswered question: Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience? — David Chalmers, Facing up to the problem of consciousness The problems of consciousness, Chalmers argues, are of two kinds: the easy problems and the hard problem . Easy problems The easy problems are amenable to reductive enquiry. They are a logical consequence of lower-level facts about the world, similar to how a clock's ability to tell time is a logical consequence of its clockwork and structure, or a hurricane being a logical consequence of the structures and functions of certain weather patterns. A clock, a hurricane, and the easy problems, are all the sum of their parts (as are most things). 28 The easy problems relevant to consciousness concern mechanistic analysis of the neural processes that accompany behaviour. Examples of these include how sensory systems work, how sensory data is processed in the brain, how that data influences behaviour or verbal reports, the neural basis of thought and emotion, and so on. They are problems that can be analysed through structures and functions . 28 Hard problem The hard problem, in contrast, is the problem of why and how those processes are accompanied by experience. 1 It may further include the question of why these processes are accompanied by this or that particular experience, rather than some other kind of experience. In other words, the hard problem is the problem of explaining why certain mechanisms are accompanied by conscious experience. 28 For example, why should neural processing in the brain lead to the felt sensations of, say, feelings of hunger? And why should those neural firings lead to feelings of hunger rather than some other feeling (such as, for example, feelings of thirst)? Chalmers argues that it is conceivable that the relevant behaviours associated with hunger, or any other feeling, could occur even in the absence of that feeling. This suggests that experience is irreducible to physical systems such as the brain. This is the topic of the next section. How the easy and hard problems are related Chalmers believes that the hard problem is irreducible to the easy problems: solving the easy problems will not lead to a solution to the hard problem. This is because the easy problems pertain to the causal structure of the world while the hard problem pertains to consciousness, and facts about consciousness include facts that go beyond mere causal or structural description. 33 For example, suppose someone were to stub their foot and yelp. In this scenario, the easy problems are mechanistic explanations that involve the activity of the nervous system and brain and its relation to the environment (such as the propagation of nerve signals from the toe to the brain, the processing of that information and how it leads to yelping, and so on). The hard problem is the question of why these mechanisms are accompanied by the feeling of pain , or why these feelings of pain feel the particular way that they do. Chalmers argues that facts about the neural mechanisms of pain, and pain behaviours, do not lead to facts about conscious experience. Facts about conscious experience are, instead, further facts , not derivable from facts about the brain. 28 33 The hard problem is often illustrated by appealing to the logical possibility of inverted visible spectra. If there is no logical contradiction in supposing that one's colour vision could be inverted, it follows that mechanistic explanations of visual processing do not determine facts about what it is like to see colours. An explanation for all of the relevant physical facts about neural processing would leave unexplained facts about what it is like to feel pain. This is in part because functions and physical structures of any sort could conceivably exist in the absence of experience. Alternatively, they could exist alongside a different set of experiences. For example, it is logically possible for a perfect replica of Chalmers to have no experience at all, or for it to have a different set of experiences (such as an inverted visible spectrum, so that the blue-yellow red-green axes of its visual field are flipped). 33 The same cannot be said about clocks, hurricanes, or other physical things. In those cases, a structural or functional description is a complete description. A perfect replica of a clock is a clock, a perfect replica of a hurricane is a hurricane, and so on. The difference is that physical things are nothing more than their physical constituents. For example, water is nothing more than H 2 O molecules, and understanding everything about H 2 O molecules is to understand everything there is to know about water. But consciousness is not like this. Knowing everything there is to know about the brain, or any physical system, is not to know everything there is to know about consciousness. Consciousness, then, must not be purely physical. 28 Implications for physicalism See also: Physicalism A swarm of birds showing high order structure emerging from simpler physical constituents Chalmers's idea contradicts physicalism , sometimes labelled materialism . This is the view that everything that exists is a physical or material thing, so everything can be reduced to microphysical things. For example, the rings of Saturn are a physical thing because they are nothing more than a complex arrangement of a large number of subatomic particles interacting in a certain way. According to physicalism, everything, including consciousness, can be explained by appeal to its microphysical constituents. Chalmers's hard problem presents a counterexample to this view and to other phenomena like swarms of birds, since it suggests that consciousness, and analogously swarms of birds, cannot be reductively explained by appealing to their physical constituents. Thus, if the hard problem is a real problem then physicalism must be false, and if physicalism is true then the hard problem must not be a real problem. citation needed Though Chalmers rejects physicalism, he is still a naturalist . 28 importance? Christian List argues that the existence of first-person perspectives and the inability for physicalism to answer Hellie's vertiginous question is evidence against physicalism, since first-personal facts cannot supervene on physical third-personal facts. 34 List also claims that there exists a quadrilemma for metaphysical theories of consciousness, and that for the metaphysical claims of first-person realism, non-solipsism, non-fragmentation, and one-world, at least one of these must be false. 35 List has proposed a model he calls the many-worlds theory of consciousness in order to reconcile the subjective nature of consciousness without lapsing into solipsism. 36 Historical precedents Wikiquote has quotations related to Hard problem of consciousness . The hard problem of consciousness has scholarly antecedents considerably earlier than Chalmers. Chalmers himself notes that a number of thinkers in the recent and distant past have recognised the particular difficulties of explaining consciousness. 37 He states that all his original 1996 paper contributed to the discussion was a catchy name, a minor reformulation of philosophically familiar points . 37 Among others, thinkers who have made arguments similar to Chalmers' formulation of the hard problem include Isaac Newton , 38 John Locke , 39 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , 40 38 John Stuart Mill , 41 and Thomas Henry Huxley . 42 38 Likewise, Asian philosophers like Dharmakirti and Guifeng Zongmi discussed the problem of how consciousness arises from unconscious matter. 38 43 44 45 The Tattva Bodha, an eighth century text attributed to Adi Shankara from the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism , describes consciousness being anubhati , or self-revealing, illuminating all objects of knowledge without itself being a material object. 46 47 Related concepts The mind–body problem Main article: Mind–body problem The mind–body problem is the problem of how the mind and the body relate. The mind-body problem is more general than the hard problem of consciousness, since it is the problem of discovering how the mind and body relate in general, thereby implicating any theoretical framework that broaches the topic. The hard problem, in contrast, is often construed as a problem uniquely faced by physicalist or materialist theories of mind. What Is It Like to Be a Bat? Main article: What Is It Like to Be a Bat? The philosopher Thomas Nagel posited in his 1974 paper What Is It Like to Be a Bat? that experiences are essentially subjective (accessible only to the individual undergoing them—i.e., felt only by the one feeling them), while physical states are essentially objective (accessible to multiple individuals). So he argued we have no idea what it could mean to claim that an essentially subjective state just is an essentially non-subjective state (i.e., that a felt state is nothing but a functional state). In other words, we have no idea of what reductivism amounts to. 32 He believes every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view. 32 Explanatory gap Main article: Explanatory gap See also: Reductionism In 1983, the philosopher Joseph Levine proposed that there is an explanatory gap between our understanding of the physical world and our understanding of consciousness. 48 Levine's disputes that conscious states are reducible to neuronal or brain states. He uses the example of pain (as an example of a conscious state) and its reduction to the firing of c-fibers (a kind of nerve cell). The difficulty is as follows: even if consciousness is physical, it is not clear which physical states correspond to which conscious states. The bridges between the two levels of description will be contingent , rather than necessary . This is significant because in most contexts, relating two scientific levels of descriptions (such as physics and chemistry) is done with the assurance of necessary connections between the two theories (for example, chemistry follows with necessity from physics). 49 Levine illustrates this with a thought experiment: Suppose that humanity were to encounter an alien species, and suppose it is known that the aliens do not have any c-fiber. Even if one knows this, it is not obvious that the aliens do not feel pain: that would remain an open question. This is because the fact that aliens do not have c-fibers does not entail that they do not feel pain (in other words, feelings of pain do not follow with logical necessity from the firing of c-fibers). Levine thinks such thought experiments demonstrate an explanatory gap between consciousness and the physical world: even if consciousness is reducible to physical things, consciousness cannot be explained in terms of physical things, because the link between physical things and consciousness is a contingent link. 49 Levine does not think that the explanatory gap means that consciousness is not physical; he is open to the idea that the explanatory gap is only an epistemological problem for physicalism. 49 In contrast, Chalmers thinks that the hard problem of consciousness does show that consciousness is not physical. 28 Philosophical zombies Main article: Philosophical zombie Philosophical zombies are a thought experiment commonly used in discussions of the hard problem. 50 51 They are hypothetical beings physically identical to humans but that lack conscious experience. 52 Philosophers such as Chalmers, Joseph Levine, and Saul Kripke take zombies as impossible within the bounds of nature but possible within the bounds of logic. 53 This would imply that facts about experience are not logically entailed by the physical facts. Therefore, consciousness is irreducible. In Chalmers' words, after God (hypothetically) created the world, he had more work to do. 54 Daniel Dennett, a philosopher of mind, criticised the field's use of the zombie hunch which he deems an embarrassment 55 that ought to be dropped like a hot potato . 30 Knowledge argument Main article: Knowledge argument The knowledge argument, also known as Mary's Room , is another common thought experiment: A hypothetical neuroscientist named Mary has lived her whole life in a black-and-white room and has never seen colour before. She also happens to know everything there is to know about the brain and colour perception. 56 Chalmers believes 54 that when Mary sees the colour red for the first time, she gains new knowledge — the knowledge of what red looks like — which is distinct from, and irreducible to, her prior physical knowledge of the brain or visual system. A stronger form of the knowledge argument 56 claims not merely that Mary would lack subjective knowledge of what red looks like, but that she would lack knowledge of an objective fact about the world: namely, what red looks like, a non-physical fact that can be learned only through direct experience (qualia). Others, such as Thomas Nagel, take a physicalist position, disagree with the argument in its stronger and/or weaker forms. 56 For example, Nagel put forward a speculative proposal of devising a language that could explain to a person blind from birth what it is like to see. 32 The knowledge argument implies that such a language could not exist. Philosophical responses David Chalmers' formulation of the hard problem of consciousness provoked considerable debate within philosophy of mind , as well as scientific research. 49 A diagram showing the relationship between various views concerning the relationship between consciousness and the physical world The hard problem is considered a problem primarily for physicalist views of the mind (the view that the mind is a physical object or process), since physical explanations tend to be functional, or structural. Because of this, some physicalists have responded to the hard problem by seeking to show that it dissolves upon analysis. Other researchers accept the problem as real and seek to develop a theory of consciousness' place in the world that can solve it, by either modifying physicalism or abandoning it in favour of an alternative ontology (such as panpsychism or dualism ). A third response has been to accept the hard problem as real but deny human cognitive faculties can solve it. PhilPapers is an organisation that archives academic philosophy papers and periodically surveys professional philosophers about their views. It can be used to gauge professional attitudes towards the hard problem. As of the 2020 survey results, it seems that the majority of philosophers (62.42%) agree that the hard problem is real, with a substantial minority that disagrees (29.76%). 25 Attitudes towards physicalism also differ among professionals. In the 2009 PhilPapers survey, 56.5% of philosophers surveyed subscribed to physicalism and 27.1% of philosophers surveyed rejected physicalism. 16.4% fell into the other category. 57 In the 2020 PhilPapers survey, 51.93% of philosophers surveyed indicated that they accept or lean towards physicalism and 32.08% indicated that they reject physicalism. 6.23% were agnostic or undecided . 25 Different solutions have been proposed to the hard problem of consciousness. The sections below taxonomize the various responses to the hard problem. The shape of this taxonomy was first introduced by Chalmers in a 2003 literature review on the topic. 58 The labelling convention of this taxonomy has been incorporated into the technical vocabulary of analytic philosophy, being used by philosophers such as Adrian Boutel, 59 Raamy Majeed, 60 Janet Levin, 61 Pete Mandik Josh Weisberg, 62 Roberto Pereira, 63 and Helen Yetter-Chappell. 64 Type-A Materialism Further information: Reductive materialism and A priori physicalism Type-A materialism (also known as reductive materialism or a priori physicalism ) is a view characterised by a commitment to physicalism and a full rejection of the hard problem. By this view, the hard problem either does not exist or is just another easy problem, because every fact about the mind is a fact about the performance of various functions or behaviours. So, once all the relevant functions and behaviours have been accounted for, there will not be any facts left over in need of explanation. 58 Thinkers who subscribe to type-A materialism include Paul and Patricia Churchland , Daniel Dennett , Keith Frankish , and Thomas Metzinger . Some type-A materialists believe in the reality of phenomenal consciousness but believe it is nothing extra in addition to certain functions or behaviours. This view is sometimes referred to as strong reductionism . 49 58 Other type-A materialists may reject the existence of phenomenal consciousness entirely. This view is referred to as eliminative materialism or illusionism . 65 66 67 Strong reductionism Many philosophers have disputed that there is a hard problem of consciousness distinct from what Chalmers calls the easy problems of consciousness. Some among them, who are sometimes termed strong reductionists , hold that phenomenal consciousness (i.e., conscious experience) does exist but that it can be fully understood as reducible to the brain. 49 Broadly, strong reductionists accept that conscious experience is real but argue it can be fully understood in functional terms as an emergent property of the material brain. 49 In contrast to weak reductionists (see above), strong reductionists reject ideas used to support the existence of a hard problem (that the same functional organization could exist without consciousness, or that a blind person who understood vision through a textbook would not know everything about sight) as simply mistaken intuitions. 49 58 A notable family of strong reductionist accounts are the higher-order theories of consciousness . 68 49 In 2005, the philosopher Peter Carruthers wrote about recognitional concepts of experience , that is, a capacity to recognize a type of experience when it occurs in one's own mental life, and suggested that such a capacity could explain phenomenal consciousness without positing qualia. 69 On the higher-order view, since consciousness is a representation, and representation is fully functionally analysable, there is no hard problem of consciousness. 49 The philosophers Glenn Carruthers and Elizabeth Schier said in 2012 that the main arguments for the existence of a hard problem— philosophical zombies , Mary's room , and Nagel's bats —are only persuasive if one already assumes that consciousness must be independent of the structure and function of mental states, i.e. that there is a hard problem. Hence, the arguments beg the question . The authors suggest that instead of letting our conclusions on the thought experiments guide our theories of consciousness, we should let our theories of consciousness guide our conclusions from the thought experiments. 70 The philosopher Massimo Pigliucci argued in 2013 that the hard problem is misguided, resulting from a category mistake . 17 He said: Of course an explanation isn't the same as an experience, but that's because the two are completely independent categories, like some more recent dualists, however, accept only one substance, the physical, but state it has both mental and physical properties (hence property dualism ). 115 Type-F Monism Main articles: Panpsychism and Neutral monism Meanwhile, panpsychism and neutral monism , broadly speaking, view consciousness as intrinsic to matter. 58 In its most basic form, panpsychism holds that all physical entities have minds (though its proponents take more qualified positions), 120 while neutral monism, in at least some variations, holds that entities are composed of a substance with mental and physical aspects—and is thus sometimes described as a type of panpsychism. 121 Forms of panpsychism and neutral monism were defended in the early twentieth century by the psychologist William James , 122 123 note 2 the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead , 123 the physicist Arthur Eddington , 124 125 and the philosopher Bertrand Russell , 120 121 and interest in these views has been revived in recent decades by philosophers including Thomas Nagel , 123 Galen Strawson , 123 126 Philip Goff , 123 and David Chalmers. 120 Chalmers describes his overall view as naturalistic dualism , 1 but he says panpsychism is in a sense a form of physicalism, 58 as does Strawson. 126 Proponents of panpsychism argue it solves the hard problem of consciousness parsimoniously by making consciousness a fundamental feature of reality. 49 127 Idealism and cosmopsychism Main article: Idealism A traditional solution to the hard problem is idealism , according to which consciousness is fundamental and not simply an emergent property of matter. It is claimed that this avoids the hard problem entirely. 128 Objective idealism and cosmopsychism consider mind or consciousness to be the fundamental substance of the universe. Proponents claim that this approach is immune to both the hard problem of consciousness and the combination problem that affects panpsychism. 129 130 131 From an idealist perspective, matter is a representation or image of mental processes. Supporters suggest that this avoids the problems associated with the mat",
