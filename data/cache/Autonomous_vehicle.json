is capable of operating with reduced or no human input . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] They are sometimes called robotaxis , though this term refers specifically to self-driving cars operated for a ridesharing company . Self-driving cars are responsible for all driving activities, such as perceiving the environment, monitoring important systems, and controlling the vehicle, which includes navigating from origin to destination. [ 6 ] As of late 2024 [ update ] , no system has achieved full autonomy (SAE Level 5). In December 2020, Waymo was the first to offer rides in self-driving taxis to the public in limited geographic areas (SAE Level 4), [ 7 ] [ failed verification ] and as of April 2024 [ update ] offers services in Arizona (Phoenix) and California (San Francisco and Los Angeles). In June 2024, after a Waymo self-driving taxi crashed into a utility pole in Phoenix, Arizona , all 672 of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles were recalled after they were found to have susceptibility to crashing into pole-like items and had their software updated. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In July 2021, DeepRoute.ai started offering self-driving taxi rides in Shenzhen, China. Starting in February 2022, Cruise offered self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, [ 11 ] but suspended service in 2023. In 2021, Honda was the first manufacturer to sell an SAE Level 3 car, [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] followed by Mercedes-Benz in 2023. [ 15 ] A Waymo -operated Jaguar I-Pace in San Francisco, 2023. This model was recalled after a crash into a pole.

[ 16 ] The first ADAS system was cruise control , which was invented in 1948 by Ralph Teetor . Trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-autonomous car was developed in 1977, by Japan's Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. [ 17 ] It required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds of 30 km/h (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Carnegie Mellon University 's Navlab [ 20 ] and ALV [ 21 ] [ 22 ] semi-autonomous projects launched in the 1980s, funded by the United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich 's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. [ 23 ] By 1985, ALV had reached 31 km/h (19 mph) , on two-lane roads. Obstacle avoidance came in 1986, and day and night off-road driving by 1987. [ 24 ] In 1995 Navlab 5 completed the first autonomous US coast-to-coast journey. Traveling from Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 98.2% of the trip was autonomous. It completed the trip at an average speed of 63.8 mph (102.7 km/h) . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Until the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence, controls, and sensor systems. [ 29 ] The US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, [ 30 ] which demonstrated automated driving, combining highway-embedded automation with vehicle technology, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and highway infrastructure. The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997. [ 31 ] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, Navlab drove 4,584 km (2,848 mi) across the US in 1995, 4,501 km (2,797 mi) or 98% autonomously. [ 32 ] In 2015, Delphi piloted a Delphi technology-based Audi, over 5,472 km (3,400 mi) through 15 states, 99% autonomously. [ 33 ] In 2015, Nevada , Florida, California, Virginia , Michigan , and Washington DC allowed autonomous car testing on public roads. [ 34 ] From 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded development for connected and automated driving through Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT programs. [ 35 ] The Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019. [ 36 ] In November 2017, Waymo announced testing of autonomous cars without a safety driver. [ 37 ] However, an employee was in the car to handle emergencies. [ 38 ] In March 2018, Elaine Herzberg became the first reported pedestrian killed by a self-driving car, an Uber test vehicle with a human backup driver; prosecutors did not charge Uber, while the human driver was sentenced to probation. [ 39 ] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a robotaxi service, in Phoenix, Arizona. [ 40 ] In October 2020, Waymo launched a robotaxi service in a ( geofenced ) part of the area. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] The cars were monitored in real-time, and remote engineers intervened to handle exceptional conditions. [ 43 ] [ 42 ] In March 2019, ahead of Roborace , Robocar set the Guinness World Record as the world's fastest autonomous car. Robocar reached 282.42 km/h (175.49 mph). [ 44 ] In March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with Level 3 \"Traffic Jam Pilot\" driving technology, which legally allowed drivers to take their eyes off the road when the car was travelling under 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 45 ] [ 14 ] In December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona . Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021. [ 46 ] DeepRoute.ai launched robotaxi service in Shenzhen in July 2021. [ 47 ] In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz received approval for a Level 3 car. [ 48 ] In February 2022, Cruise became the second service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in San Francisco . [ 11 ] In December 2022, several manufacturers scaled back plans for self-driving technology, including Ford and Volkswagen . [ 49 ] In 2023, Cruise suspended its robotaxi service. [ 50 ] Nuro was approved for Level 4 in Palo Alto in August, 2023. [ 51 ] As of August 2023 [ update ] , vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor ; [ citation needed ] as of early 2024, Honda leases a Level 3 car in Japan, and Mercedes sells two Level 3 cars in Germany, California and Nevada. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] BMW also sells its Level 3 Personal Pilot in Germany. [ 54 ] Definitions Organizations such as SAE have proposed terminology standards. However, most terms have no standard definition and are employed variously by vendors and others. Proposals to adopt aviation automation terminology for cars have not prevailed. [ 55 ] Names such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot are used even though the products offer an assortment of features that may not match the names. [ 56 ] Despite offering a system dubbed \"Full Self-Driving\" , Tesla stated that its system did not autonomously handle all driving tasks. [ 57 ] In the United Kingdom, a fully self-driving car is defined as a car so registered, rather than one that supports a specific feature set. [ 58 ] The Association of British Insurers claimed that the usage of the word autonomous in marketing was dangerous because car ads make motorists think \"autonomous\" and \"autopilot\" imply that the driver can rely on the car to control itself, even though they do not. Automated driving system SAE identified 6 levels for driving automation from level 0 to level 5. [ 59 ] An ADS is an SAE J3016 level 3 or higher system. Advanced driver assistance system Main article: Advanced driver-assistance system An ADAS is a system that automates specific driving features, such as Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) or Blind Spot Warning (BSW). [ 60 ] An ADAS requires a human driver to handle tasks that the ADAS does not support. Autonomy versus automation Autonomy implies that an automation system is under the control of the vehicle rather than a driver. Automation is function-specific, handling issues such as speed control, but leaves broader decision-making to the driver. [ 61 ] Euro NCAP defined autonomous as \"the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident\". [ 62 ] In Europe, the words automated and autonomous can be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 supplied: [ 63 ] \"automated vehicle\" means a vehicle that can move without continuous driver supervision, but that driver intervention is still expected or required in the operational design domains (ODD); [ 63 ] \"fully automated vehicle\" means a vehicle that can move entirely without driver supervision; [ 63 ] Cooperative system A remote driver is a driver that operates a vehicle at a distance, using a video and data connection. [ 64 ] According to SAE J3016 , .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;margin-top:0}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{padding-left:1.6em}} Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.

The context is defined by a set of conditions, including environmental, geographical, time of day, and other conditions. For vehicles, traffic and roadway characteristics are included. Manufacturers use ODD to indicate where/how their product operates safely. A given system may operate differently according to the immediate ODD. [ 65 ] The concept presumes that automated systems have limitations. [ 66 ] Relating system function to the ODD it supports is important for developers and regulators to establish and communicate safe operating conditions. Systems should operate within those limitations. Some systems recognize the ODD and modify their behavior accordingly. For example, an autonomous car might recognize that traffic is heavy and disable its automated lane change feature. [ 66 ] Vendors have taken a variety of approaches to the self-driving problem. Tesla's approach is to allow their \"full self-driving\" (FSD) system to be used in all ODDs as a Level 2 (hands/on, eyes/on) ADAS. [ 67 ] Waymo picked specific ODDs (city streets in Phoenix and San Francisco) for their Level 5 robotaxi service. [ 68 ] Mercedes Benz offers Level 3 service in Las Vegas in highway traffic jams at speeds up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) . [ 69 ] Mobileye's SuperVision system offers hands-off/eyes-on driving on all road types at speeds up to 130 kilometres per hour (81 mph) . [ 70 ] GM's hands-free Super Cruise operates on specific roads in specific conditions, stopping or returning control to the driver when ODD changes. In 2024 the company announced plans to expand road coverage from 400,000 miles to 750,000 miles. [ 71 ] Ford's BlueCruise hands-off system operates on 130,000 miles of US divided highways. [ 72 ] Self-driving The Union of Concerned Scientists defined self-driving as \"cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or 'driverless' cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.\" [ 73 ] The British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines a vehicle as \"driving itself\" if the vehicle is \"not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual\". [ 74 ] Another British government definition stated, \"Self-driving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves\". [ 75 ] British definitions In British English, the word automated alone has several meanings, such as in the sentence: \"Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as 'automated driving', preferring 'assisted driving'\". [ 76 ] The first occurrence of the \"automated\" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. British law interprets the meaning of \"automated vehicle\" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle \"driving itself\" and an insured vehicle. [ 77 ] In November 2023 the British Government introduced the Automated Vehicles Bill. It proposed definitions for related terms: [ 78 ] Self-driving: \"A vehicle “satisfies the self-driving test” if it is designed or adapted with the intention that a feature of the vehicle will allow it to travel autonomously, and it is capable of doing so, by means of that feature, safely and legally.\" Autonomy: A vehicle travels \"autonomously\" if it is controlled by the vehicle, and neither the vehicle nor its surroundings are monitored by a person who can intervene. Control: control of vehicle motion. Safe: a vehicle that conforms to an acceptably safe standard. Legal: a vehicle that offers an acceptably low risk of committing a traffic infraction. SAE classification Tesla Autopilot is classified as an SAE Level 2 system. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] A six-level classification system – ranging from fully manual to fully automated – was published in 2014 by SAE International as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems ; the details are revised occasionally. [ 81 ] This classification is based on the role of the driver, rather than the vehicle's capabilities, although these are related. After SAE updated its classification in 2016, (J3016_201609), [ 82 ] the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) adopted the SAE standard. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] The classification is a topic of debate, with various revisions proposed. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] Classifications A \"driving mode\", aka driving scenario , combines an ODD with matched driving requirements (e.g., expressway merging, traffic jam). [ 1 ] [ 87 ] Cars may switch levels in accord with the driving mode. Above Level 1, level differences are related to how responsibility for safe movement is divided/shared between ADAS and driver rather than specific driving features.

System 4 High Automation If a driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene, the car can stop safely. System Many 5 Full Automation System controls the vehicle under all conditions and circumstances. All SAE Automation Levels have been criticized [ by whom? ] for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not be the case. [ 88 ] SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure [ 89 ] and road user behavior. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Mobileye System Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua and CTO Shai Shalev-Shwartz proposed an alternative taxonomy for autonomous driving systems, claiming that a more consumer-friendly approach was needed. Its categories reflect the amount of driver engagement that is required. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Some vehicle makers have informally adopted some of the terminology involved, while not formally committing to it. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Eyes-on/hands-on The first level, hands-on/eyes-on, implies that the driver is fully engaged in operating the vehicle, but is supervised by the system, which intervenes according to the features it supports (e.g., adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking). The driver is entirely responsible, with hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. [ 93 ] Eyes-on/hands-off Eyes-on/hands-off allows the driver to let go of the wheel. The system drives, the driver monitors, and remains prepared to resume control as needed. [ 93 ] Eyes-off/hands-off Eyes-off/hands-off means that the driver can stop monitoring the system, leaving the system in full control. Eyes-off requires that no errors be reproducible (not triggered by exotic transitory conditions) or frequent, that speeds are contextually appropriate (e.g., 80 mph on limited-access roads), and that the system handles typical maneuvers (e.g., getting cut off by another vehicle). The automation level could vary according to the road (e.g., eyes-off on freeways, eyes-on on side streets). [ 93 ] No driver The highest level does not require a human driver in the car: monitoring is done either remotely (telepresence) or not at all. [ 93 ] Safety A critical requirement for the higher two levels is that the vehicle be able to conduct a Minimum Risk Maneuver and stop safely out of traffic without driver intervention. [ 93 ] Technology Main article: Vehicular automation Architecture The perception system processes visual and audio data from outside and inside the car to create a local model of the vehicle, the road, traffic, traffic controls and other observable objects, and their relative motion. The control system then takes actions to move the vehicle, considering the local model, road map, and driving regulations. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Several classifications have been proposed to describe ADAS technology. One proposal is to adopt these categories: navigation, path planning, perception, and car control. [ 102 ] Navigation Main article: Hybrid navigation Navigation involves the use of maps to define a path between origin and destination. Hybrid navigation is the use of multiple navigation systems . Some systems use basic maps, relying on perception to deal with anomalies. Such a map understands which roads lead to which others, whether a road is a freeway, a highway, are one-way, etc. Other systems require highly detailed maps, including lane maps, obstacles, traffic controls, etc. Perception ACs need to be able to perceive the world around them. Supporting technologies include combinations of cameras, LiDAR , radar , audio, and ultrasound , [ 103 ] GPS , and inertial measurement . [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Deep neural networks are used to analyse inputs from these sensors to detect and identify objects and their trajectories. [ 107 ] Some systems use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Another technique is detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), used to handle potential obstacles. [ 108 ] [ 109 ] Other systems use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) technologies to aid localization. Tesla's \"vision only\" system uses eight cameras, without LIDAR or radar, to create its bird's-eye view of the environment. [ 110 ] Path planning Path planning finds a sequence of segments that a vehicle can use to move from origin to destination. Techniques used for path planning include graph-based search and variational-based optimization techniques. Graph-based techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicle/obstacle. Variational-based optimization techniques require more stringent restrictions on the vehicle's path to prevent collisions. [ 111 ] The large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a voronoi diagram , an occupancy grid mapping , or a driving corridor algorithm. The latter allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open space that is bounded by lanes or barriers. [ 112 ] Maps Maps are necessary for navigation. Map sophistication varies from simple graphs that show which roads connect to each other, with details such as one-way vs two-way, to those that are highly detailed, with information about lanes, traffic controls, roadworks, and more. [ 103 ] Researchers at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developed a system called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive with simple maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a \"sparse topological map\" such as OpenStreetMap (which has only 2D road features), with sensors that observe road conditions. [ 113 ] One issue with highly detailed maps is updating them as the world changes. Vehicles that can operate with less-detailed maps do not require frequent updates or geo-fencing. Sensors Sensors are necessary for the vehicle to properly respond to the driving environment. Sensor types include cameras, LiDAR , ultrasound , and radar . Control systems typically combine data from multiple sensors . [ 114 ] Multiple sensors can provide a more complete view of the surroundings and can be used to cross-check each other to correct errors. [ 115 ] For example, radar can image a scene in, e.g., a nighttime snowstorm, that defeats cameras and LiDAR, albeit at reduced precision. After experimenting with radar and ultrasound, Tesla adopted a vision-only approach, asserting that humans drive using only vision, and that cars should be able to do the same, while citing the lower cost of cameras versus other sensor types. [ 116 ] By contrast, Waymo makes use of the higher resolution of LiDAR sensors and cites the declining cost of that technology. [ 117 ] Drive by wire Main article: Drive by wire Drive by wire is the use of electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions such as steering or speed control that are traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages. Driver monitoring Main article: Driver monitoring system Driver monitoring is used to assess the driver's attention and alertness. Techniques in use include eye monitoring, and requiring the driver to maintain torque on the steering wheel. [ 118 ] It attempts to understand driver status and identify dangerous driving behaviors. [ 119 ] Vehicle communication Main article: Vehicular communication systems Vehicles can potentially benefit from communicating with others to share information about traffic, road obstacles, to receive map and software updates, etc. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 103 ] ISO /TC 22 specifies in-vehicle transport information and control systems, [ 122 ] while ISO/TC 204 specifies information, communication and control systems in surface transport. [ 123 ] International standards have been developed for ADAS functions, connectivity, human interaction, in-vehicle systems, management/engineering, dynamic map and positioning, privacy and security. [ 124 ] Rather than communicating among vehicles, they can communicate with road-based systems to receive similar information. Software update See also: Over-the-air programming Software controls the vehicle, and can provide entertainment and other services. Over-the-air updates can deliver bug fixes and additional features over the internet. Software updates are one way to accomplish recalls that in the past required a visit to a service center. In March 2021, the UNECE regulation on software update and software update management systems was published. [ 125 ] Safety model A safety model is software that attempts to formalize rules that ensure that ACs operate safely. [ 126 ] IEEE is attempting to forge a standard for safety models as \"IEEE P2846: A Formal Model for Safety Considerations in Automated Vehicle Decision Making\". [ 127 ] In 2022, a research group at National Institute of Informatics (NII, Japan) enhanced Mobileye's Reliable Safety System as \"Goal-Aware RSS\" to enable RSS rules to deal with complex scenarios via program logic. [ 128 ] Notification The US has standardized the use of turquoise lights to inform other drivers that a vehicle is driving autonomously. It will be used in the 2026 Mercedes-Benz EQS and S-Class sedans with Drive Pilot, an SAE Level 3 driving system. [ citation needed ] As of 2023, the Turquoise light had not been standardized by the P.R.C or the UN-ECE. [ 129 ] Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in the development and operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), enabling them to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and navigate safely without human intervention. AI algorithms empower AVs to interpret sensory data from various onboard sensors, such as cameras, LiDAR, radar, and GPS, to understand their environment and improve its technological ability and overall safety over time. [ 130 ] Challenges Autonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another Obstacles The primary obstacle to ACs is the advanced software and mapping required to make them work safely across the wide variety of conditions that drivers experience. [ 131 ] In addition to handling day/night driving in good and bad weather [ 132 ] on roads of arbitrary quality, ACs must cope with other vehicles, road obstacles, poor/missing traffic controls, flawed maps, and handle endless edge cases, such as following the instructions of a police officer managing traffic at a crash site. Other obstacles include cost, liability, [ 133 ] [ 134 ] consumer reluctance, [ 135 ] ethical dilemmas, [ 136 ] [ 137 ] security, [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] privacy, [ 132 ] and legal/regulatory framework. [ 142 ] Further, AVs could automate the work of professional drivers, eliminating many jobs, which could slow acceptance. [ 143 ] Concerns Deceptive marketing Tesla calls its Level 2 ADAS \"Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta\". [ 144 ] US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate this marketing in 2021. [ 145 ] In December 2021 in Japan, Mercedes-Benz was punished by the Consumer Affairs Agency for misleading product descriptions. [ 146 ] Mercedes-Benz was criticized for a misleading US commercial advertising E-Class models . [ 147 ] At that time, Mercedes-Benz rejected the claims and stopped its \"self-driving car\" ad campaign that had been running. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] In August 2022, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of deceptive marketing practices. [ 150 ] With the Automated Vehicles Bill (AVB) self-driving car-makers could face prison for misleading adverts in the United-Kingdom. [ 151 ] Security In the 2020s, concerns over ACs' vulnerability to cyberattacks and data theft emerged. [ 152 ] Espionage In 2018 and 2019, former Apple engineers were charged with stealing information related to Apple's self-driving car project. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ] In 2021 the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) accused Chinese security officials of coordinating a hacking campaign to steal information from government entities, including research related to autonomous vehicles. [ 156 ] [ 157 ] China has prepared \"the Provisions on Management of Automotive Data Security (Trial) to protect its own data\". [ 158 ] [ 159 ] Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything technologies are based on 5G wireless networks . [ 160 ] As of November 2022 [ update ] , the US Congress was considering the possibility that imported Chinese AC technology could facilitate espionage. [ 161 ] Testing of Chinese automated cars in the US has raised concern over which US data are collected by Chinese vehicles to be stored in China and any link with the Chinese communist party. [ 162 ] Driver communications ACs complicate the need for drivers to communicate with each other, e.g., to decide which car enters an intersection first. In an AC without a driver, traditional means such as hand signals do not work (no driver, no hands). [ 163 ] Behavior prediction ACs must be able to predict the behavior of possibly moving vehicles, pedestrians, etc, in real time in order to proceed safely. [ 100 ] The task becomes more challenging the further into the future the prediction extends, requiring rapid revisions to the estimate to cope with unpredicted behavior. One approach is to wholly recompute the position and trajectory of each object many times per second. Another is to cache the results of an earlier prediction for use in the next one to reduce computational complexity. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Handover The ADAS has to be able to safely accept control from and return control to the driver. [ 166 ] Trust Consumers will avoid ACs unless they trust them as safe. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] Robotaxis operating in San Francisco received pushback over perceived safety risks. [ 169 ] Automatic elevators were invented in 1900, but did not become common until operator strikes and trust was built with advertising and features such as an emergency stop button. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] However, with repeated use of autonomous driving functions, drivers' behavior and trust in autonomous vehicles gradually improved and both entered a more stable state. At the same time, this also improved the performance and reliability of the vehicle in complex conditions, thereby increasing public trust. [ 172 ] Economics Autonomy also presents various political and economic implications. The transportation sector holds significant sway in many political and economic landscapes. For instance, many US states generate much annual revenue from transportation fees and taxes. [ 173 ] The advent of self-driving cars could profoundly affect the economy by potentially altering state tax revenue streams. Furthermore, the transition to autonomous vehicles might disrupt employment patterns and labor markets, particularly in industries heavily reliant on driving professions. [ 173 ] Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that in 2019, the sector employed over two million individuals as tractor-trailer truck drivers. [ 174 ] Additionally, taxi and delivery drivers represented approximately 370,400 positions, and bus drivers constituted a workforce of over 680,000. [ 175 ] [ 176 ] [ 177 ] Collectively, this amounts to a conceivable displacement of nearly 2.9 million jobs, surpassing the job losses experienced in the 2008 Great Recession. [ 178 ] Equity and inclusion The prominence of certain demographic groups within the tech industry inevitably shapes the trajectory of autonomous vehicle (AV) development, potentially perpetuating existing inequalities. [ 179 ] Ethical issues See also: Machine ethics Pedestrian detection Research from Georgia Tech revealed that autonomous vehicle detection systems were generally five percent less effective at recognizing darker-skinned individuals. This accuracy gap persisted despite adjustments for environmental variables like lighting and visual obstructions. [ 180 ] Rationale for liability Standards for liability have yet to be adopted to address crashes and other incidents. Liability could rest with the vehicle occupant, its owner, the vehicle manufacturer, or even the ADAS technology supplier, possibly depending on the circumstances of the crash. [ 181 ] Additionally, the infusion of ArtificiaI Intelligence technology in autonomous vehicles adds layers of complexity to ownership and ethical dynamics. Given that AI systems are inherently self-learning, a question arises of whether accountability should rest with the vehicle owner, the manufacturer, or the AI developer. [ 182 ] Trolley problem The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics . Adapted for ACs, it considers an AC carrying one passenger confronting a pedestrian who steps in its way. The ADAS notionally has to choose between killing the pedestrian or swerving into a wall, killing the passenger. [ 183 ] Possible frameworks include deontology (formal rules) and utilitarianism (harm reduction). [ 100 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] One public opinion survey reported that harm reduction was preferred, except that passengers wanted the vehicle to prefer them, while pedestrians took the opposite view. Utilitarian regulations were unpopular. [ 186 ] Additionally, cultural viewpoints exert substantial influence on shaping responses to these ethical quandaries. Another study found that cultural biases impact preferences in prioritizing the rescue of certain individuals over others in car accident scenarios. [ 182 ] Privacy Some ACs require an internet connection to function, opening the possibility that a hacker might gain access to private information such as destinations, routes, camera recordings, media preferences, and/or behavioral patterns, although this is true of an internet-connected device. [ 187 ] [ 188 ] [ 189 ] Road infrastructure ACs make use of road infrastructure (e.g., traffic signs, turn lanes) and may require modifications to that infrastructure to fully achieve their safety and other goals. [ 190 ] In March 2023, the Japanese government unveiled a plan to set up a dedicated highway lane for ACs. [ 191 ] In April 2023, JR East announced their challenge to raise their self-driving level of Kesennuma Line bus rapid transit (BRT) in rural area from the current Level 2 to Level 4 at 60 km/h. [ 192 ] Testing Approaches ACs can be tested via digital simulations, [ 193 ] [ 194 ] in a controlled test environment, [ 195 ] and/or on public roads. Road testing typically requires some form of permit [ 196 ] or a commitment to adhere to acceptable operating principles. [ 197 ] For example, New York requires a test driver to be in the vehicle, prepared to override the ADAS as necessary. [ 198 ] 2010s and disengagements A prototype of Waymo 's self-driving car, navigating public streets in Mountain View, California in 2017 In California, self-driving car manufacturers are required to submit annual reports describing how often their vehicles autonomously disengaged from autonomous mode. [ 199 ] This is one measure of system robustness (ideally, the system should never disengage). [ 200 ] In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352,545 mi (567,366 km) of testing, an average distance of 5,596 mi (9,006 km) between disengagements, the highest (best) among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also logged more autonomous miles than other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017, Uber reported an average of 0.67 mi (1.08 km) per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, Cruise (owned by GM ) averaged 5,224 mi (8,407 km) per disengagement over 62,689 mi (100,888 km) .

[ 203 ] [ 200 ] Executives of self-driving car companies have criticized disengagements as a deceptive metric, because it does not consider varying road conditions. [ 204 ] Standards In April 2021, WP.29 GRVA proposed a \"Test Method for Automated Driving (NATM)\". [ 205 ] In October 2021, Europe's pilot test, L3Pilot, demonstrated ADAS for cars in Hamburg , Germany, in conjunction with ITS World Congress 2021 . SAE Level 3 and 4 functions were tested on ordinary roads. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] [ 208 ] In November 2022, an International Standard ISO 34502 on \" Scenario based safety evaluation framework\" was published. [ 209 ] [ 210 ] Collision avoidance In April 2022, collision avoidance testing was demonstrated by Nissan . [ 211 ] [ 212 ] Waymo published a document about collision avoidance testing in December 2022. [ 213 ] Simulation and validation In September 2022, Biprogy released Driving Intelligence Validation Platform (DIVP) as part of Japanese national project \"SIP-adus\", which is interoperable with Open Simulation Interface (OSI) of ASAM . [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ] Toyota In November 2022, Toyota demonstrated one of its GR Yaris test cars, which had been trained using professional rally drivers. [ 217 ] Toyota used its collaboration with Microsoft in FIA World Rally Championship since the 2017 season. [ 218 ] Pedestrian reactions In 2023 David R. Large, senior research fellow with the Human Factors Research Group at the University of Nottingham , disguised himself as a car seat in a study to test people's reactions to driverless cars. He said, \"We wanted to explore how pedestrians would interact with a driverless car and developed this unique methodology to explore their reactions.\" The study found that, in the absence of someone in the driving seat, pedestrians trust certain visual prompts more than others when deciding whether to cross the road. [ 219 ] Incidents Tesla See also: List of Tesla Autopilot crashes As of 2023, Tesla's ADAS Autopilot /Full Self Driving (beta) was classified as Level 2 ADAS. [ 220 ] On 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred, in China's Hubei province. [ 221 ] Initially, Tesla stated that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to determine whether the car had been on Autopilot at the time. However, the car failed to take evasive action. Another fatal Autopilot crash occurred in May in Florida in a Tesla Model S [ 222 ] [ 223 ] that crashed into a tractor-trailer . In a civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla documented that the car had been on Autopilot. [ 224 ] According to Tesla, \"neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.\" Tesla claimed that this was Tesla's first known Autopilot death in over 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) with Autopilot engaged. Tesla claimed that on average one fatality occurs every 94 million miles (151 million kilometers) across all vehicle types in the US. [ 225 ] [ 226 ] [ 227 ] However, this number also includes motorcycle/pedestrian fataliti",
