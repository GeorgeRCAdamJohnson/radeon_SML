  "content": "Surveillance Monitoring something for the purposes of influencing, protecting, or suppressing it This article is about surveillance in security and is not to be confused with Health surveillance . Electronic surveillance redirects here; not to be confused with Computer and network surveillance . Surveillance cameras in Gdynia , Poland Surveillance Camera to support the Washington, DC Police Surveillance is the systematic observation and monitoring of a person, population , or location, with the purpose of information-gathering, influencing, managing , or directing. 1 2 It is widely used by governments for a variety of reasons, such as law enforcement , national security , and information awareness. It can also be used as a tactic by persons who are not working on behalf of a government, by criminal organizations to plan and commit crimes, and by businesses to gather intelligence on criminals, their competitors, suppliers or customers. Religious organizations charged with detecting heresy and heterodoxy may also carry out surveillance. 3 Various kinds of auditors carry out a form of surveillance. 4 Surveillance is done in a variety of methods, such as human interaction and postal interception , and more recently closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Surveillance can unjustifiably violate people's privacy and is often criticized by civil liberties activists. 5 Democracies may have laws that seek to restrict governmental and private use of surveillance, whereas authoritarian governments seldom have any domestic restrictions. Increasingly, government and intelligence agencies have conducted surveillance by obtaining consumer data through the purchase of online information. 6 Improvements in the technology available to states has led to surveillance on a mass and global scale. Espionage is by definition covert and typically illegal according to the rules of the observed party, whereas most types of surveillance are overt and are considered legal or legitimate by state authorities. International espionage seems to be common among all types of countries. 7 8 Methods Computer Official seal of the Information Awareness Office – a U.S. agency which developed technologies for mass surveillance Main article: Computer surveillance See also: Profiling (information science) The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet . 9 In the United States for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act , all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by federal law enforcement agencies. 10 11 12 There is far too much data on the Internet for human investigators to manually search through all of it. Therefore, automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic to identify and report to human investigators the traffic that is considered interesting or suspicious. This process is regulated by targeting certain trigger words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or online chat with suspicious individuals or groups. 13 Billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies, such as the NSA , the FBI and the now-defunct Information Awareness Office , to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as Carnivore , NarusInsight , and ECHELON to intercept and analyze all of this data to extract only the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. 14 Computers can be a surveillance target because of the personal data stored on them. If someone is able to install software, such as the FBI's Magic Lantern and CIPAV , on a computer system, they can easily gain unauthorized access to this data. Such software could be installed physically or remotely. 15 Another form of computer surveillance, known as van Eck phreaking , involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters. 16 17 The NSA runs a database known as Pinwale , which stores and indexes large numbers of emails of both American citizens and foreigners. 18 19 Additionally, the NSA runs a program known as PRISM , which is a data mining system that gives the United States government direct access to information from technology companies . Through accessing this information, the government is able to obtain search history, emails, stored information, live chats, file transfers, and more. This program generated huge controversies in regards to surveillance and privacy, especially from U.S. citizens. 20 21 Telephones Main articles: Phone surveillance and Lawful interception The official and unofficial tapping of telephone lines is widespread. In the United States for instance, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires that all telephone and VoIP communications be available for real-time wiretapping by Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. 10 11 12 Two major telecommunications companies in the U.S.— AT T Inc. and Verizon —have contracts with the FBI, requiring them to keep their phone call records easily searchable and accessible for Federal agencies, in return for $1.8 million per year. 22 Between 2003 and 2005, the FBI sent out more than 140,000 National Security Letters ordering phone companies to hand over information about their customers' calling and Internet histories. About half of these letters requested information on U.S. citizens. 23 Human agents are not required to monitor most calls. Speech-to-text software creates machine-readable text from intercepted audio, which is then processed by automated call-analysis programs, such as those developed by agencies such as the Information Awareness Office , or companies such as Verint , and Narus , which search for certain words or phrases, to decide whether to dedicate a human agent to the call. 24 Law enforcement and intelligence services in the United Kingdom and the United States possess technology to activate the microphones in cell phones remotely, by accessing phones' diagnostic or maintenance features in order to listen to conversations that take place near the person who holds the phone. 25 26 27 28 29 30 The StingRay tracker is an example of one of these tools used to monitor cell phone usage in the United States and the United Kingdom. Originally developed for counterterrorism purposes by the military, they work by broadcasting powerful signals that cause nearby cell phones to transmit their IMSI number , just as they would to normal cell phone towers. Once the phone is connected to the device, there is no way for the user to know that they are being tracked. The operator of the stingray is able to extract information such as location, phone calls, and text messages, but it is widely believed that the capabilities of the StingRay extend much further. A lot of controversy surrounds the StingRay because of its powerful capabilities and the secrecy that surrounds it. 31 Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data. The geographical location of a mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily even when the phone is not being used, using a technique known as multilateration to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several cell towers near the owner of the phone. 32 33 The legality of such techniques has been questioned in the United States, in particular whether a court warrant is required. 34 Records for one carrier alone (Sprint), showed that in a given year federal law enforcement agencies requested customer location data 8 million times. 35 The headquarters of UK intelligence activities is Government Communications Headquarters , Cheltenham , England (2017) In response to customers' privacy concerns in the post Edward Snowden era, 36 Apple's iPhone 6 has been designed to disrupt investigative wiretapping efforts. The phone encrypts e-mails, contacts, and photos with a code generated by a complex mathematical algorithm that is unique to an individual phone, and is inaccessible to Apple. 37 The encryption feature on the iPhone 6 has drawn criticism from FBI director James B. Comey and other law enforcement officials since even lawful requests to access user content on the iPhone 6 will result in Apple supplying gibberish data that requires law enforcement personnel to either break the code themselves or to get the code from the phone's owner. 37 Because the Snowden leaks demonstrated that American agencies can access phones anywhere in the world, privacy concerns in countries with growing markets for smart phones have intensified, providing a strong incentive for companies like Apple to address those concerns in order to secure their position in the global market. 37 Apple has made several moves to emphasize their concern for privacy, in order to appeal to more consumers. In 2011, Apple stopped the use of permanent device identifiers, and in 2019, they banned the ability of third parties to track on children's apps. 38 Although the CALEA requires telecommunications companies to build into their systems the ability to carry out a lawful wiretap, the law has not been updated to address the issue of smart phones and requests for access to e-mails and metadata . 39 The Snowden leaks show that the NSA has been taking advantage of this ambiguity in the law by collecting metadata on at least hundreds of millions of incidental targets from around the world. 39 The NSA uses an analytic tool known as CO-TRAVELER in order to track people whose movements intersect and to find any hidden connections with persons of interest. 39 The Snowden leaks have also revealed that the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) can access information collected by the NSA on American citizens. Once the data has been collected, the GCHQ can hold on to it for up to two years. The deadline can be extended with the permission of a senior UK official . 40 41 Cameras Main article: Closed-circuit television A surveillance camera in Cairns, Queensland Surveillance cameras such as these are installed by the millions in many countries, and are nowadays monitored by automated computer programs instead of humans. Surveillance cameras, or security cameras, are video cameras used for the purpose of observing an area. They are often connected to a recording device or IP network , and may be watched by a security guard or law enforcement officer . Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage, but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable database , and by video analysis software (such as VIRAT and HumanID ). The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which record only when motion is detected. With cheaper production techniques, surveillance cameras are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in home security systems, and for everyday surveillance. Video cameras are one of the most common methods of surveillance. 42 As of 2016, there are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years. 43 In 2018, China was reported to have a huge surveillance network of over 170 million CCTV cameras with 400 million new cameras expected to be installed in the next three years, many of which use facial recognition technology . 44 In the United States , the Department of Homeland Security awards billions of dollars per year in Homeland Security grants for local, state, and federal agencies to install modern video surveillance equipment. For example, the city of Chicago , Illinois, recently used a $5.1 million Homeland Security grant to install an additional 250 surveillance cameras, and connect them to a centralized monitoring center, along with its preexisting network of over 2000 cameras, in a program known as Operation Virtual Shield . Speaking in 2009, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley announced that Chicago would have a surveillance camera on every street corner by 2016. 45 46 New York City received a $350 million grant towards the development of the Domain Awareness System , 47 which is an interconnected system of sensors including 18,000 CCTV cameras used for continual surveillance of the city 48 by both police officers and artificial intelligence systems . 47 In the United Kingdom , the vast majority of video surveillance cameras are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 Freedom of Information Act requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK. 49 The prevalence of video surveillance in the UK is often overstated due to unreliable estimates being requoted; 50 51 for example one report in 2002 extrapolated from a very small sample to estimate the number of cameras in the UK at 4.2 million (of which 500,000 were in Greater London ). 52 More reliable estimates put the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom at around 1.85 million in 2011. 53 In the Netherlands, one example city where there are cameras is The Hague. There, cameras are placed in city districts in which the most illegal activity is concentrated. Examples are the red-light districts and the train stations. 54 As part of China's Golden Shield Project , several U.S. corporations, including IBM , General Electric , and Honeywell , have been working closely with the Chinese government to install millions of surveillance cameras throughout China , along with advanced video analytics and facial recognition software, which will identify and track individuals everywhere they go. They will be connected to a centralized database and monitoring station, which will, upon completion of the project, contain a picture of the face of every person in China: over 1.3 billion people. 55 Lin Jiang Huai, the head of China's Information Security Technology office (which is in charge of the project), credits the surveillance systems in the United States and the U.K. as the inspiration for what he is doing with the Golden Shield Project. 55 A payload surveillance camera manufactured by Controp and distributed to the U.S. government by ADI Technologies The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is funding a research project called Combat Zones That See that will link up cameras across a city to a centralized monitoring station, identify and track individuals and vehicles as they move through the city, and report suspicious activity (such as waving arms, looking side-to-side, standing in a group, etc.). 56 At Super Bowl XXXV in January 2001, police in Tampa, Florida, used Identix's facial recognition software, FaceIt, to scan the crowd for potential criminals and terrorists in attendance at the event 57 (it found 19 people with pending arrest warrants). 58 Governments often initially claim that cameras are meant to be used for traffic control , but many of them end up using them for general surveillance. citation needed For example, Washington, D.C. had 5,000 traffic cameras installed under this premise, and then after they were all in place, networked them all together and then granted access to the Metropolitan Police Department, so they could perform day-to-day monitoring . 59 The development of centralized networks of CCTV cameras watching public areas—linked to computer databases of people's pictures and identity ( biometric data), able to track people's movements throughout the city, and identify whom they have been with—has been argued by some to present a risk to civil liberties . 60 Trapwire is an example of such a network. 61 Social network analysis A graph of the relationships between users on the social networking site Facebook . Social network analysis enables governments to gather detailed information about peoples' friends, family, and other contacts. Since much of this information is voluntarily made public by the users themselves, it is often considered to be a form of open-source intelligence One common form of surveillance is to create maps of social networks based on data from social networking sites such as Facebook , MySpace , Twitter as well as from traffic analysis information from phone call records such as those in the NSA call database , 62 and others. These social network maps are then data mined to extract useful information such as personal interests, friendships affiliations, wants, beliefs, thoughts, and activities. 63 64 65 Many U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are investing heavily in research involving social network analysis. 66 67 The intelligence community believes that the biggest threat to U.S. power comes from decentralized, leaderless, geographically dispersed groups of terrorists , subversives , extremists , and dissidents . These types of threats are most easily countered by finding important nodes in the network, and removing them. To do this requires a detailed map of the network. 68 69 70 Jason Ethier of Northeastern University, in his study of modern social network analysis, said the following of the Scalable Social Network Analysis Program developed by the Information Awareness Office : , ' > The purpose of the SSNA algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people.... In order to be successful SSNA will require information on the social interactions of the majority of people around the globe. Since the Defense Department cannot easily distinguish between peaceful citizens and terrorists, it will be necessary for them to gather data on innocent civilians as well as on potential terrorists. — Jason Ethier 65 AT T developed a programming language called Hancock , which is able to sift through enormous databases of phone call and Internet traffic records, such as the NSA call database , and extract communities of interest —groups of people who call each other regularly, or groups that regularly visit certain sites on the Internet. AT T originally built the system to develop marketing leads , 71 but the FBI has regularly requested such information from phone companies such as AT T without a warrant, 71 and, after using the data, stores all information received in its own databases, regardless of whether or not the information was ever useful in an investigation. 72 Some people believe that the use of social networking sites is a form of participatory surveillance , where users of these sites are essentially performing surveillance on themselves, putting detailed personal information on public websites where it can be viewed by corporations and governments. 63 In 2008, about 20% of employers reported using social networking sites to collect personal data on prospective or current employees. 73 Biometric Fingerprints being scanned as part of the US-VISIT program Main article: Biometrics Biometric surveillance is a technology that measures and analyzes human physical and/or behavioral characteristics for authentication, identification, or screening purposes. 74 Examples of physical characteristics include fingerprints, DNA, and facial patterns. Examples of mostly behavioral characteristics include gait (a person's manner of walking) or voice. Facial recognition is the use of the unique configuration of a person's facial features to accurately identify them, usually from surveillance video. Both the Department of Homeland Security and DARPA are heavily funding research into facial recognition systems. 75 The Information Processing Technology Office ran a program known as Human Identification at a Distance which developed technologies that are capable of identifying a person at up to 500 ft (150 m) by their facial features. Another form of behavioral biometrics, based on affective computing , involves computers recognizing a person's emotional state based on an analysis of their facial expressions, how fast they are talking, the tone and pitch of their voice, their posture, and other behavioral traits. This might be used for instance to see if a person's behavior is suspect (looking around furtively, tense or angry facial expressions, waving arms, etc.). 76 A more recent development is DNA profiling , which looks at some of the major markers in the body's DNA to produce a match. The FBI is spending $1 billion to build a new biometric database, which will store DNA, facial recognition data, iris/retina (eye) data, fingerprints, palm prints, and other biometric data of people living in the United States. The computers running the database are contained in an underground facility about the size of two American football fields . 77 78 79 The Los Angeles Police Department is installing automated facial recognition and license plate recognition devices in its squad cars, and providing handheld face scanners, which officers will use to identify people while on patrol. 80 81 82 Facial thermographs are in development, which allow machines to identify certain emotions in people such as fear or stress, by measuring the temperature generated by blood flow to different parts of the face. 83 Law enforcement officers believe that this has potential for them to identify when a suspect is nervous, which might indicate that they are hiding something, lying, or worried about something. 83 In his paper in Ethics and Information Technology , Avi Marciano maps the harms caused by biometric surveillance, traces their theoretical origins, and brings these harms together in one integrative framework to elucidate their cumulative power. Marciano proposes four types of harms: Unauthorized use of bodily information, denial or limitation of access to physical spaces, bodily social sorting, and symbolic ineligibility through construction of they felt that it was dehumanizing to have all of their movements tracked with RFID chips. 117 vague Some critics have expressed fears that people will soon be tracked and scanned everywhere they go. 118 On the other hand, RFID tags in newborn baby ID bracelets put on by hospitals have foiled kidnappings. 117 In a 2003 editorial, CNET News.com's chief political correspondent, Declan McCullagh, speculated that, soon, every object that is purchased, and perhaps ID cards, will have RFID devices in them, which would respond with information about people as they walk past scanners (what type of phone they have, what type of shoes they have on, which books they are carrying, what credit cards or membership cards they have, etc.). This information could be used for identification, tracking, or targeted marketing . As of 2021 update , this has largely not come to pass. 119 RFID tagging on humans Main article: Microchip implant (human) Hand with planned insertion point for Verichip device A human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or RFID transponder encased in silicate glass and implanted in the body of a human being. A subdermal implant typically contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database, such as personal identification, medical history, medications, allergies, and contact information. Several types of microchips have been developed in order to control and monitor certain types of people, such as criminals, political figures and spies, clarification needed a killer tracking chip patent was filed at the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) around May 2009. Verichip is an RFID device produced by a company called Applied Digital Solutions (ADS). Verichip is slightly larger than a grain of rice, and is injected under the skin. The injection reportedly feels similar to receiving a shot . The chip is encased in glass, and stores a VeriChip Subscriber Number which the scanner uses to access their personal information, via the Internet, from Verichip Inc.'s database, the Global VeriChip Subscriber Registry . Thousands of people have already had them inserted. 118 In Mexico, for example, 160 workers at the Attorney General's office were required to have the chip injected for identity verification and access control purposes. 120 121 Implantable microchips have also been used in healthcare settings, but ethnographic researchers have identified a number of ethical problems with such uses; these problems include unequal treatment, diminished trust, and possible endangerment of patients. 122 Radar This section is an excerpt from Perimeter surveillance radar . edit Perimeter surveillance radar (PSR) is a class of radar sensors that monitor activity surrounding or on critical infrastructure areas such as airports, 123 seaports, military installations, national borders, refineries and other critical industry and the like. Such radars are characterized by their ability to detect movement at ground level of targets such as an individual walking or crawling towards a facility. Such radars typically have ranges of several hundred metres to over 10 kilometres. 124 Alternate technologies include laser-based systems. These have the potential for very high target position accuracy, however they are less effective in the presence of fog and other obscurants. Geolocation devices Global Positioning System Diagram of GPS satellites orbiting Earth See also: GPS tracking In the U.S., police have planted hidden GPS tracking devices in people's vehicles to monitor their movements, 125 without a warrant. 126 In early 2009, they were arguing in court that they have the right to do this. 127 Several cities are running pilot projects to require parolees to wear GPS devices to track their movements when they get out of prison. 128 Devices See also: United States v. Spy Factory, Inc. Covert listening devices and video devices, or bugs , are hidden electronic devices which are used to capture, record, and/or transmit data to a receiving party such as a law enforcement agency. The U.S. has run numerous domestic intelligence operations, such as COINTELPRO , which have bugged the homes, offices, and vehicles of thousands of U.S. citizens, usually political activists , subversives , and criminals . 129 Law enforcement and intelligence services in the U.K. and the United States possess technology to remotely activate the microphones in cell phones, by accessing the phone's diagnostic/maintenance features, in order to listen to conversations that take place nearby the person who holds the phone. 26 27 28 Postal services As more people use faxes and e-mail the significance of surveilling the postal system is decreasing, in favor of Internet and telephone surveillance. But interception of post is still an available option for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, in certain circumstances. 130 This is not a common practice, however, and entities like the US Army require high levels of approval to conduct. 131 The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation have performed twelve separate mail-opening campaigns targeted towards U.S. citizens. In one of these programs, more than 215,000 communications were intercepted, opened, and photographed. 132 133 Stakeout Stakeout redirects here. For other uses, see Stakeout (disambiguation) . A stakeout is the coordinated surveillance of a location or person. Stakeouts are generally performed covertly and for the purpose of gathering evidence related to criminal activity . The term derives from the practice by land surveyors of using survey stakes to measure out an area before the main building project begins. Internet of things The Internet of Things (IoT), is a network of physical devices. These devices can collect data to one another without human intervention. IoTs can be used for identification, monitoring, location tracking, and health tracking. 134 While IoTs can be used as time-saving tools that make activities simpler, they raise the concern of government surveillance and privacy regarding how data will be used. 134 Controversy Graffiti expressing concern about the proliferation of video surveillance Support Supporters of surveillance systems believe that these tools can help protect society from terrorists and criminals . They argue that surveillance can reduce crime by three means: by deterrence, by observation, and by reconstruction. Surveillance can deter by increasing the chance of being caught, and by revealing the modus operandi . This requires a minimal level of invasiveness. 135 Another method on how surveillance can be used to fight criminal activity is by linking the information stream obtained from them to a recognition system (for instance, a camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system). This can for instance auto-recognize fugitives and direct police to their location. A distinction here has to be made however on the type of surveillance employed. Some people that support video surveillance in city streets may not support indiscriminate telephone taps and vice versa. Besides the types, the way in which this surveillance is done also matters a lot; i.e. indiscriminate telephone taps are supported by much fewer people than say telephone taps done only to people suspected of engaging in illegal activities. Surveillance can also be used to give human operatives a tactical advantage through improved situational awareness, or through the use of automated processes, i.e. video analytics . Surveillance can help reconstruct an incident and prove guilt through the availability of footage for forensics experts. Surveillance can also influence subjective security if surveillance resources are visible or if the consequences of surveillance can be felt. Some of the surveillance systems (such as the camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system mentioned above) can also have other uses besides countering criminal activity. For instance, it can help in retrieving runaway children, abducted or missing adults and mentally disabled people. Other supporters simply believe that there is nothing that can be done about the loss of privacy, and that people must become accustomed to having no privacy. As Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said: You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it. 136 137 Another common argument is: If you aren't doing something wrong then you don't have anything to fear . That is, one does not have a right to privacy regarding illegal activities, while those following the law suffer no harm from surveillance and so have no standing to object to it. Beyond the heroically self-serving identification of what is wrong with what is illegal, the ethical fly in this ointment is the tacit premise that the individual has no duty to preserve the health of the state—the antithesis of the principle that only the consent of the governed can adequately serve as the moral foundation of a (just) state and warrant the vast gulf between its power (and agency) and that of the individual. 138 Opposition Surveillance lamppost brought down in Hong Kong by citizens fearing state surveillance An elaborate graffito in Columbus, Ohio, depicting state surveillance of telecommunications With the advent of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program and ADVISE , technologies such as high speed surveillance computers and biometrics software, and laws such as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of their subjects. 139 Many civil rights and privacy groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union , have expressed concern that by allowing continual increases in government surveillance of citizens we will end up in a mass surveillance society, with extremely limited, or non-existent political and/or personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as Hepting v. AT T . 139 140 Some critics state that the claim made by supporters should be modified to read: As long as we do what we're told, we have nothing to fear. For instance, a person who is part of a political group which opposes the policies of the national government, might not want the government to know their names and what they have been reading, so that the government cannot easily subvert their organization, arrest, or kill them. Other critics state that while a person might not have anything to hide right now, the government might later implement policies that they do wish to oppose, and that opposition might then be impossible due to mass surveillance enabling the government to identify and remove political threats. Further, other critics point to the fact that most people do have things to hide. For example, if a person is looking for a new job, they might not want their current employer to know this. Also if an employer wishes total privacy to watch over their own employee and secure their financial information it may become impossible, and they may not wish to hire those under surveillance. In December 2017, the Government of China took steps to oppose widespread surveillance by security-company cameras, webcams, and IP cameras after tens-of-thousands were made accessible for internet viewing by IT company Qihoo . 141 Totalitarianism A traffic camera atop a high pole oversees a road in the Canadian city of Toronto. Programs such as the Total Information Awareness program, and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act have led many groups to fear that society is moving towards a state of mass surveillance with severely limited personal, social, political freedoms, where dissenting individuals or groups will be strategically removed in COINTELPRO -like purges. 139 140 Kate Martin, of the Center For National Security Studies said of the use of military spy satellites being used to monitor the activities of U.S. citizens: They are laying the bricks one at a time for a police state. 111 Some point to the blurring of lines between public and private places, and the privatization of places traditionally seen as public (such as shopping malls and industrial parks) as illustrating the increasing legality of collecting personal information. 142 Traveling through many public places such as government offices is hardly optional for most people, yet consumers have little choice but to submit to companies' surveillance practices. 143 Surveillance techniqu",
