[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies. [ 4 ] Some transhumanists speculate that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings of such vastly greater abilities as to merit the label of posthuman beings. [ 2 ] Another topic of transhumanist research is how to protect humanity against existential risks , including artificial general intelligence , asteroid impact , gray goo , pandemic , societal collapse , and nuclear warfare . [ 5 ] The biologist Julian Huxley popularised the term \"transhumanism\" in a 1957 essay. [ 6 ] The contemporary meaning of the term was foreshadowed by one of the first professors of futurology , a man who changed his name to FM-2030 . In the 1960s, he taught \"new concepts of the human\" at The New School when he began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles, and worldviews \"transitional\" to posthumanity as \" transhuman \". [ 7 ] The assertion laid the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher Max More to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy in 1990, organizing in California a school of thought that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Influenced by seminal works of science fiction , the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives, including philosophy and religion. [ 7 ] History Precursors of transhumanism According to Nick Bostrom , transcendentalist impulses have been expressed at least as far back as the quest for immortality in the Epic of Gilgamesh , as well as in historical quests for the Fountain of Youth , the Elixir of Life , and other efforts to stave off aging and death. [ 2 ] Transhumanists draw upon and claim continuity from intellectual and cultural traditions such as the ancient philosophy of Aristotle or the scientific tradition of Roger Bacon . [ 10 ] In his Divine Comedy , Dante coined the word trasumanar meaning \"to transcend human nature, to pass beyond human nature\" in the first canto of Paradiso . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The interweaving of transhumanist aspirations with the scientific imagination can be seen in the works of some precursors of Enlightenment such as Francis Bacon . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] One of the early precursors to transhumanist ideas is René Descartes 's Discourse on Method (1637), in which Descartes envisions a new kind of medicine that can grant both physical immortality and stronger minds. [ 17 ] In his first edition of Political Justice (1793), William Godwin included arguments favoring the possibility of \"earthly immortality \" (what would now be called physical immortality ). Godwin explored the themes of life extension and immortality in his gothic novel St. Leon , which became popular (and notorious) at the time of its publication in 1799, but is now mostly forgotten. St. Leon may have inspired his daughter Mary Shelley 's novel Frankenstein . [ 18 ] There is debate about whether the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche can be considered an influence on transhumanism, despite its exaltation of the Übermensch (overhuman), due to its emphasis on self-actualization rather than technological transformation. [ 2 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The transhumanist philosophies of More and Sorgner have been influenced strongly by Nietzschean thinking. [ 19 ] By contrast, The Transhumanist Declaration \"advocates the well-being of all sentience (whether in artificial intellects, humans, posthumans, or non-human animals)\". [ 22 ] The late 19th- to early 20th-century movement known as Russian cosmism , by Russian philosopher N. F. Fyodorov , is noted for anticipating transhumanist ideas. [ 23 ] In 1966, FM-2030 (formerly F. M. Esfandiary), a futurist who taught \"new concepts of the human\" at The New School , in New York City , began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and worldviews transitional to posthumanity as \" transhuman \". [ 24 ] Early transhumanist thinking Julian Huxley , the biologist who popularised the term transhumanism in an influential 1957 essay [ 6 ] Fundamental ideas of transhumanism were first advanced in 1923 by the British geneticist J. B. S. Haldane in his essay Daedalus: Science and the Future , which predicted that great benefits would come from the application of advanced sciences to human biology—and that every such advance would first appear to someone as blasphemy or perversion, \"indecent and unnatural\". [ 25 ] In particular, he was interested in the development of the science of ectogenesis (creating and sustaining life in an artificial environment), eugenics , and the application of genetics to improve human characteristics such as health and intelligence. His article inspired academic and popular interest. J. D. Bernal , a crystallographer at Cambridge , wrote The World, the Flesh and the Devil in 1929, in which he speculated on the prospects of space colonization and radical changes to human bodies and intelligence through bionic implants and cognitive enhancement . [ 26 ] These ideas have been common transhumanist themes ever since. [ 2 ] The biologist Julian Huxley is generally regarded as the founder of transhumanism after using the term for the title of an influential 1957 article. [ 6 ] But the term derives from a 1940 paper by the Canadian philosopher W. D. Lighthall . [ 27 ] Huxley describes transhumanism in these terms: \"}},\"i\":0}}]}' id=\"mwAQo\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;margin-top:0}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{padding-left:1.6em}} Up till now human life has generally been, as Hobbes described it, \"nasty, brutish and short\"; the great majority of human beings (if they have not already died young) have been afflicted with misery… we can justifiably hold the belief that these lands of possibility exist, and that the present limitations and miserable frustrations of our existence could be in large measure surmounted… The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself—not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity. [ 6 ] Huxley's definition differs, albeit not substantially, from the one commonly in use since the 1980s. The ideas raised by these thinkers were explored in the science fiction of the 1960s, notably in Arthur C. Clarke 's 2001: A Space Odyssey , in which an alien artifact grants transcendent power to its wielder. [ 28 ] Japanese Metabolist architects produced a manifesto in 1960 which outlined goals to \"encourage active metabolic development of our society\" [ 29 ] through design and technology. In the Material and Man section of the manifesto, Noboru Kawazoe suggests that: After several decades, with the rapid progress of communication technology, every one will have a \"brain wave receiver\" in his ear, which conveys directly and exactly what other people think about him and vice versa. What I think will be known by all the people. There is no more individual consciousness, only the will of mankind as a whole. [ 30 ] Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity The concept of the technological singularity , or the ultra-rapid advent of superhuman intelligence, was first proposed by the British cryptologist I. J. Good in 1965: I.J. Good, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090420061605/http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Good-IJ/SCtFUM.html \\\"Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine\\\"] ([http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/pages/ultraintelligentmachine.html HTML] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128085512/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf |date=November 28, 2011 }}), &apos;&apos;Advances in Computers&apos;&apos;, vol. 6, 1965.&lt;/ref>\"}},\"i\":0}}]}' id=\"mwASo\"/> Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an \"intelligence explosion,\" and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make. [ 31 ] Computer scientist Marvin Minsky wrote on relationships between human and artificial intelligence beginning in the 1960s. [ 32 ] Over the succeeding decades, this field continued to generate influential thinkers, such as Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil , who oscillated between the technical arena and futuristic speculations in the transhumanist vein. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] The coalescence of an identifiable transhumanist movement began in the last decades of the 20th century. In 1972, Robert Ettinger , whose 1964 Prospect of Immortality founded the cryonics movement , [ 35 ] contributed to the conceptualization of \"transhumanity\" with his 1972 Man into Superman. [ 36 ] FM-2030 published the Upwingers Manifesto in 1973. [ 37 ] Growth of transhumanism See also: List of transhumanists The first self-described transhumanists met formally in the early 1980s at the University of California, Los Angeles , which became the main center of transhumanist thought. Here, FM-2030 lectured on his \" Third Way \" futurist ideology. [ 38 ] At the EZTV Media venue, frequented by transhumanists and other futurists, Natasha Vita-More presented Breaking Away , her 1980 experimental film with the theme of humans breaking away from their biological limitations and the Earth's gravity as they head into space. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] FM-2030 and Vita-More soon began holding gatherings for transhumanists in Los Angeles , which included students from FM-2030's courses and audiences from Vita-More's artistic productions. In 1982, Vita-More authored the Transhumanist Arts Statement [ 41 ] and in 1988 she produced the cable TV show TransCentury Update on transhumanity, a program that reached over 100,000 viewers. In 1986, Eric Drexler published Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology , [ 42 ] which discussed the prospects for nanotechnology and molecular assemblers , and founded the Foresight Institute . As the first nonprofit organization to research, advocate for, and perform cryonics , the Southern California offices of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation became a center for futurists. In 1988, the first issue of Extropy Magazine was published by Max More and Tom Morrow. In 1990, More, a strategic philosopher, created his own particular transhumanist doctrine, which took the form of the Principles of Extropy, and laid the foundation of modern transhumanism by giving it a new definition: [ 43 ] Transhumanism is a class of philosophies that seek to guide us towards a posthuman condition. Transhumanism shares many elements of humanism, including a respect for reason and science, a commitment to progress, and a valuing of human (or transhuman) existence in this life. [...] Transhumanism differs from humanism in recognizing and anticipating the radical alterations in the nature and possibilities of our lives resulting from various sciences and technologies [...] In 1992, More and Morrow founded the Extropy Institute , a catalyst for networking futurists and brainstorming new memeplexes by organizing a series of conferences and, more importantly, providing a mailing list, which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during the rise of cyberculture and the cyberdelic counterculture. In 1998, philosophers Nick Bostrom and David Pearce founded the World Transhumanist Association (WTA), an international non-governmental organization working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and public policy . [ 44 ] In 2002, the WTA modified and adopted The Transhumanist Declaration. [ 22 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] The Transhumanist FAQ , prepared by the WTA (later Humanity+ ), gave two formal definitions for transhumanism: [ 47 ] The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason, especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities. The study of the ramifications, promises, and potential dangers of technologies that will enable us to overcome fundamental human limitations, and the related study of the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies. In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations, WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their futurist visions and needed to be addressed. [ 7 ] A particular concern is equal access to human enhancement technologies across classes and borders. [ 48 ] In 2006, a political struggle within the transhumanist movement between the libertarian right and the liberal left resulted in a more centre-leftward positioning of the WTA under its former executive director James Hughes . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] In 2006, the board of directors of the Extropy Institute ceased operations of the organization, saying that its mission was \"essentially completed\". [ 50 ] This left the World Transhumanist Association as the leading international transhumanist organization. In 2008, as part of a rebranding effort, the WTA changed its name to \" Humanity+ \". [ 51 ] In 2012, the transhumanist Longevity Party had been initiated as an international union of people who promote the development of scientific and technological means to significant life extension that now has more than 30 national organisations throughout the world. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] The Mormon Transhumanist Association was founded in 2006. [ 54 ] By 2012, it had hundreds of members. [ 55 ] The first transhumanist elected member of a parliament was Giuseppe Vatinno , in 2012 in Italy. [ 56 ] In 2017, Penn State University Press , in cooperation with philosopher Stefan Lorenz Sorgner and sociologist James Hughes , established the Journal of Posthuman Studies [ 57 ] as the first academic journal explicitly dedicated to the posthuman, with the goal of clarifying the notions of posthumanism and transhumanism, as well as comparing and contrasting both. Theory It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of posthumanism and how this philosophical movement should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Transhumanism is often referred to as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its conservative , [ 60 ] Christian [ 61 ] and progressive [ 62 ] [ 63 ] critics. [ 64 ] A common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is the future vision of a new intelligent species, into which humanity will evolve and which eventually will supplement or supersede it. Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective, including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement (i.e. biological uplift ), [ 7 ] but clings to a \"posthuman future\" as the final goal of participant evolution. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Nevertheless, the idea of creating intelligent artificial beings (proposed, for example, by roboticist Hans Moravec ) has influenced transhumanism. [ 33 ] Moravec's ideas and transhumanism have also been characterised as a \"complacent\" or \" apocalyptic \" variant of posthumanism and contrasted with \" cultural posthumanism \" in humanities and the arts. [ 67 ] While such a \"cultural posthumanism\" would offer resources for rethinking the relationships between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines, transhumanism and similar posthumanisms are, in this view, not abandoning obsolete concepts of the \" autonomous liberal subject \", but are expanding its \" prerogatives \" into the realm of the posthuman . [ 68 ] Transhumanist self-characterisations as a continuation of humanism and Enlightenment thinking correspond with this view. Some secular humanists conceive transhumanism as an offspring of the humanist freethought movement and argue that transhumanists differ from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological approaches to resolving human concerns (i.e. technocentrism ) and on the issue of mortality. [ 69 ] Other progressives have argued that posthumanism, in its philosophical or activist forms, amounts to a shift away from concerns about social justice , from the reform of human institutions and from other Enlightenment preoccupations, toward narcissistic longings to transcend the human body in quest of more exquisite ways of being. [ 70 ] The philosophy of transhumanism is closely related to technoself studies , an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society and focusing on the changing nature of relationships between humans and technology.

This is the dream of artificial intelligence. — Byte , April 1985 [ 72 ] Ray Kurzweil believes that a countdown to when \" human life will be irreversibly transformed \" can be made through plotting major world events on a graph. While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply reason, science and technology to reduce poverty, disease, disability, and malnutrition around the globe, [ 47 ] transhumanism is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level. Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of all life , while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating congenital mental and physical barriers . Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a perfectionist ethical imperative for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition, but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to enter a transhuman phase of existence in which humans enhance themselves beyond what is naturally human. In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate participatory or directed evolution . Some theorists such as Ray Kurzweil think that the pace of technological innovation is accelerating and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical technological advances, but possibly a technological singularity , which may fundamentally change the nature of human beings. [ 73 ] Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable, but some are concerned about the dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly. For example, Bostrom has written extensively on existential risks to humanity's future welfare, including ones that emerging technologies could create. [ 74 ] In contrast, some proponents of transhumanism view it as essential to humanity's survival. For instance, Stephen Hawking points out that the \"external transmission\" phase of human evolution, where knowledge production and knowledge management is more important than transmission of information via evolution , may be the point at which human civilization becomes unstable and self-destructs, one of Hawking's explanations for the Fermi paradox . To counter this, Hawking emphasizes either self-design of the human genome or mechanical enhancement (e.g., brain-computer interface ) to enhance human intelligence and reduce aggression , without which he implies human civilization may be too stupid collectively to survive an increasingly unstable system, resulting in societal collapse . [ 75 ] While many people believe that all transhumanists are striving for immortality, that is not necessarily true. Hank Pellissier, managing director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (2011–2012), surveyed transhumanists. He found that, of the 818 respondents, 23.8% did not want immortality. [ 76 ] Some of the reasons argued were boredom, Earth's overpopulation, and the desire \"to go to an afterlife\". [ 76 ] Ethics Transhumanists engage in interdisciplinary approaches to understand and evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on futurology and various fields of ethics. [ citation needed ] Unlike many philosophers, social critics, and activists who morally value preservation of natural systems, transhumanists see the concept of the specifically natural as problematically nebulous at best and an obstacle to progress at worst. [ 77 ] In keeping with this, many prominent transhumanist advocates, such as Dan Agin, call transhumanism's critics, on the political right and left jointly, \" bioconservatives \" or \" bioluddites \", the latter term alluding to the 19th-century anti-industrialisation social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines. [ 78 ] A belief of counter-transhumanism is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement in many areas of life, but specifically on the social plane. This can be compared to steroid use, where athletes who use steroids in sports have an advantage over those who do not . The same disparity may happen when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the workplace and in education. [ 79 ] Additionally, according to M.J. McNamee and S.D. Edwards, many fear that the improvements afforded by a specific, privileged section of society will lead to a division of the human species into two different species. [ 80 ] The idea of two human species, one at a great physical and economic advantage over with the other, is troublesome at best. One may be incapable of breeding with the other, and may by consequence of lower physical health and ability, be considered of a lower moral standing than the other. [ 80 ] Nick Bostrom has said that transhumanism advocates for the wellbeing of all sentient beings, including non-human animals , extraterrestrials , and artificial forms of life. [ 81 ] This view is reiterated by David Pearce , who advocates the use of biotechnology to eradicate suffering in all sentient beings . [ 82 ] Currents There is a variety of opinions within transhumanist thought. Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development. [ 83 ] Some distinctive currents of transhumanism are identified and listed here in alphabetical order: Abolitionism , the concept of using biotechnology to eradicate suffering in all sentient beings. [ 82 ] Democratic transhumanism , a political ideology synthesizing liberal democracy , social democracy , radical democracy and transhumanism. [ 84 ] Equalism , a socioeconomic theory based upon the idea that emerging technologies will put an end to social stratification through even distribution of resources in the technological singularity era. [ 85 ] Extropianism , an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a proactive approach to human evolution. [ 43 ] Immortalism , a moral ideology based upon the belief that radical life extension and technological immortality is possible and desirable, and advocating research and development to ensure its realization. [ 86 ] Libertarian transhumanism , a political ideology synthesizing libertarianism and transhumanism. [ 78 ] Postgenderism , a social philosophy which seeks the voluntary elimination of gender in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and assisted reproductive technologies . [ 87 ] Postpoliticism , a transhumanist political proposal that aims to create a \" postdemocratic state \" based on reason and free access of enhancement technologies to people. [ 88 ] Singularitarianism , a moral ideology based upon the belief that a technological singularity is possible, and advocating deliberate action to effect it and ensure its safety. [ 73 ] Technogaianism , an ecological ideology based upon the belief that emerging technologies can help restore Earth's environment and that developing safe, clean , alternative technology should therefore be an important goal of environmentalists . [ 84 ] Spirituality Although many transhumanists are atheists , agnostics , or secular humanists , some have religious or spiritual views. [ 44 ] Despite the prevailing secular attitude, some transhumanists pursue hopes traditionally espoused by religions, such as immortality, [ 86 ] while several controversial new religious movements from the late 20th century have explicitly embraced transhumanist goals of transforming the human condition by applying technology to alter the mind and body, such as Raëlism . [ 89 ] But most thinkers associated with the transhumanism focus on the practical goals of using technology to help achieve longer and healthier lives, while speculating that future understanding of neurotheology and the application of neurotechnology will enable humans to gain greater control of altered states of consciousness , which were commonly interpreted as spiritual experiences , and thus achieve more profound self-knowledge . [ 90 ] Transhumanist Buddhists have sought to explore areas of agreement between various types of Buddhism and Buddhist-derived meditation and mind-expanding neurotechnologies. [ 91 ] They have been criticised for appropriating mindfulness as a tool for transcending humanness. [ 92 ] Some transhumanists believe in the compatibility between the human mind and computer hardware, with the theoretical implication that human consciousness may someday be transferred to alternative media (a speculative technique commonly known as mind uploading ). [ 93 ] One extreme formulation of this idea that interests some transhumanists is the proposal of the Omega Point by Christian cosmologist Frank Tipler . Drawing upon ideas in digitalism , Tipler has advanced the notion that the collapse of the Universe billions of years hence could create the conditions for the perpetuation of humanity in a simulated reality within a megacomputer and thus achieve a form of \" posthuman godhood \". Before Tipler, the term Omega Point was used by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin , a paleontologist and Jesuit theologian who saw an evolutionary telos in the development of an encompassing noosphere , a global consciousness. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] Viewed from the perspective of some Christian thinkers, the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a denigration of the human body , characteristic of gnostic manichaean belief. [ 97 ] Transhumanism and its presumed intellectual progenitors have also been described as neo-gnostic by non-Christian and secular commentators. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] The first dialogue between transhumanism and faith was a one-day conference at the University of Toronto in 2004. [ 100 ] Religious critics alone faulted transhumanism for offering no eternal truths or relationship with the divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie . Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment . [ 101 ] Following this dialogue, William Sims Bainbridge , a sociologist of religion , conducted a pilot study, published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology , suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that people with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs. [ 102 ] Since 2006, the Mormon Transhumanist Association sponsors conferences and lectures on the intersection of technology and religion. [ 103 ] The Christian Transhumanist Association [ 104 ] was established in 2014. Since 2009, the American Academy of Religion holds a \"Transhumanism and Religion\" consultation during its annual meeting, where scholars in the field of religious studies seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions; consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future, in particular the prospect of human transformation, whether by technological or other means; and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology, robotics and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species. [ 105 ] The physicist and transhumanist thinker Giulio Prisco states that \"cosmist religions based on science, might be our best protection from reckless pursuit of superintelligence and other risky technologies.\" [ 106 ] He also recognizes the importance of spiritual ideas, such as those of Russian Orthodox philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov , to the origins of the transhumanism movement. Practice While some transhumanists such as Ray Kurzweil and Hans Moravec take an abstract and theoretical approach to the perceived benefits of emerging technologies, others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body, including heritable ones. Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human nervous system . Though some, such as Kevin Warwick , propose modification of the peripheral nervous system , the brain is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions. [ 107 ] In fact, Warwick has gone a lot further than merely making a proposal. In 2002 he had a 100 electrode array surgically implanted into the median nerves of his left arm to link his nervous system directly with a computer and thus to also connect with the internet. As a consequence, he carried out a series of experiments. He was able to directly control a robot hand using his neural signals and to feel the force applied by the hand through feedback from the fingertips. He also experienced a form of ultrasonic sensory input and conducted the first purely electronic communication between his own nervous system and that of his wife who also had electrodes implanted. [ 108 ] As proponents of self-improvement and body modification , transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance, while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity. [ 109 ] Depending on their age, some transhumanists, such as Kurzweil, express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies. However, many have a great interest in life extension strategies and in funding research in cryonics to make the latter a viable option of last resort, rather than remaining an unproven method. [ 110 ] While most transhumanist theory focuses on future technologies and the changes they may bring, many today are already involved in the practice on a very basic level. It is not uncommon for many to receive cosmetic changes to their physical form via cosmetic surgery, even if it is not required for health reasons. Human growth hormones attempt to alter the natural development of shorter children or those who have been born with a physical deficiency. Doctors prescribe medicines such as Ritalin and Adderall to improve cognitive focus, and many people take \"lifestyle\" drugs such as Viagra, Propecia, and Botox to restore aspects of youthfulness that have been lost in maturity. [ 111 ] Other transhumanists, such as cyborg artist Neil Harbisson , use technologies and techniques to improve their senses and perception of reality. Harbisson's antenna, which is permanently implanted in his skull, allows him to sense colours beyond human perception such as infrareds and ultraviolets. [ 112 ] Technologies of interest Main article: Human enhancement technologies Transhumanists support the emergence and convergence of technologies including nanotechnology , biotechnology , information technology and cognitive science (NBIC), as well as hypothetical future technologies like simulated reality , artificial intelligence, superintelligence , 3D bioprinting , mind uploading , chemical brain preservation and cryonics. They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become more than human . [ 113 ] Therefore, they support the recognition or protection of cognitive liberty , morphological freedom and procreative liberty as civil liberties , so as to guarantee individuals the choice of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children. [ 114 ] Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than at the midpoint of the 21st century. Kurzweil's book The Singularity is Near and Michio Kaku's book Physics of the Future outline various human enhancement technologies and give insight on how these technologies may impact the human race. [ 73 ] [ 115 ] Some reports on the converging technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged science fictional character. [ 116 ] At the same time, research on brain and body alteration technologies has been accelerated under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of Defense , which is interested in the battlefield advantages they would provide to the supersoldiers of the United States and its allies. [ 117 ] There has already been a brain research program to \"extend the ability to manage information\", while military scientists are now looking at stretching the human capacity for combat to a maximum 168 hours without sleep. [ 118 ] Neuroscientist Anders Sandberg has been practicing on the method of scanning ultra-thin sections of the brain. This method is being used to help better understand the architecture of the brain. It is currently being used on mice. This is the first step towards hypothetically uploading contents of the human brain, including memories and emotions, onto a computer . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] Debate The very notion and prospect of human enhancement and related issues arouse public controversy. [ 121 ] Criticisms of transhumanism and its proposals take two main forms: those objecting to the likelihood of transhumanist goals being achieved (practical criticisms) and those objecting to the moral principles or worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying transhumanism itself (ethical criticisms). Critics and opponents often see transhumanists' goals as posing threats to human values. [ 122 ] [ 123 ] The human enhancement debate is, for some, framed by the opposition between strong bioconservatism and transhumanism. The former opposes any form of human enhancement, whereas the latter advocates for all possible human enhancements. [ 124 ] But many philosophers hold a more nuanced view in favour of some enhancements while rejecting the transhumanist carte blanche approach. [ 125 ] Transhumanists argue that parents have a moral responsibility called procreative beneficence to make use of these methods, if and when they are shown to be reasonably safe and effective, to have the healthiest children possible. They believe this responsibility is a moral judgment best left to individual conscience, rather than imposed by law, in all but extreme cases. In this context, the emphasis on freedom of choice is called procreative liberty . [ 7 ] Some of the best-known critiques of the transhumanist program are novels and fictional films. These works, despite presenting imagined worlds rather than ",
