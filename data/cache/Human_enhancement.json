  "content": "Human enhancement Natural, artificial, or technological alteration of the human body For the book edited by Julian Savulescu and Nick Bostrom, see Human Enhancement (book) . body.skin-minerva body.skin--responsive Part of a series on Human enhancement Advocacy Rationale Adaptionist Beneficient Emancipatory Compensatory Democratic Directive Libertarian Metahumanistic Posthumanistic Prometheist Preventative Transhumanistic Paradigm Biohappiness Cyborgs Eugenics Intelligence amplification Moral enhancement Prostheses ( De facto ) germline interventions Selective Cloning Counseling Genetic Genomic Pre-conception Genetic enhancement Genetic engineering Epigenome editing PGD Embryo quality Oocyte selection Polygenic (risk) score (technical article) Prenatal testing Selective abortion Sex selection Sperm sorting Nobelist sperm banks Somatic interventions Body hacking Somatic gene therapy for so as to guarantee them the freedom of choice and informed consent of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children. 33 Their common understanding of the world can be seen from a physicist perspective rather than a biological perspective. 34 Based on the idea of technological singularity , human enhancement is merging with technological innovation that will advance post-humanism. 34 Neuromarketing consultant Zack Lynch argues that neurotechnologies will have a more immediate effect on society than gene therapy and will face less resistance as a pathway of radical human enhancement. He also argues that the concept of enablement needs to be added to the debate over therapy versus enhancement . 35 The prospect of human enhancement has sparked public controversy. 36 37 38 The main ethical question in the debate about human enhancement involves which legal restrictions, if any, should exist. 39 Dale Carrico wrote that human enhancement is a loaded term which has eugenic overtones because it may imply the improvement of human hereditary traits to attain a universally accepted norm of biological fitness (at the possible expense of human biodiversity and neurodiversity ), and therefore can evoke negative reactions far beyond the specific meaning of the term. 40 Michael Selgelid terms this as a phase of neugenics suggesting that gene enhancements occurring now have already revived the idea of eugenics in our society. Practices of prenatal diagnosis , selective abortion and in-vitro fertilization aims to improve human life allowing for parents to decide via genetic information if they want to continue or terminate the pregnancy . 41 A criticism of human enhancement is that it will create unfair physical or mental advantages, or unequal access to such enhancements, can and will further the gulf between the haves and have-nots . 42 43 44 45 Futurist Ray Kurzweil has shown some concern that, within the century, humans may be required to merge with this technology in order to compete in the marketplace. 34 Enhanced individuals have a better chance of being chosen for better opportunities in careers, entertainment and resources. 46 For example, life-extending technologies can increase the average individual life span, affecting the distribution of pension throughout the society. Increasing lifespan will affect human population, further dividing limited resources such as food, energy, monetary resources and habitat. 46 Other critics of human enhancement fear that such capabilities would change, for the worse, the dynamic relations within a family. Given the choices of superior qualities, parents make their child as opposed to merely birthing it, and the newborn becomes a product of their will rather than a gift of nature to be loved unconditionally. 47 Effects on identity Human enhancement technologies can impact human identity by affecting one's self-conception. 48 The argument does not necessarily come from the idea of improving the individual but rather changing who they are and becoming someone new. Altering an individual identity affects their personal story, development and mental capabilities. The basis of this argument comes from two main points: the charge of inauthenticity and the charge of violating an individual's core characteristics. 48 Gene therapy has the ability to alter one's mental capacity, and through this argument, has the ability to affect their narrative identity . 48 An individual's core characteristics may include internal psychological style, personality , general intelligence , necessity to sleep, normal aging , gender and being Homo sapiens . Technologies threaten to alter the self fundamentally to the point where the result is, essentially, a different person entirely. 48 For example, extreme changes in personality may affect the individual's relationships because others can no longer relate to the new person. 45 The capability approach focuses on a normative framework that can be applied to how human enhancement technologies affects human capabilities. 49 The ethics of this does not necessarily focus on the make up of the individual but rather what it allows individuals to do in today's society. This approach was first termed by Amartya Sen , where he mainly focused on the objectives of the approach rather than the aim for those objectives which entail resources, technological processes, and economic arrangement. 49 The central human capabilities include life , bodily health, bodily integrity, sense , emotions , practical reason , affiliation, other species , play, and control over one's environment. This normative framework recognizes that human capabilities are always changing and technology has already played a part in this. 49 See also Biology portal Science portal Technology portal Anti-aging movement Assisted reproductive technologies Biohappiness Body modification Cloning Directed evolution (transhumanism) Evidence-based learning Gene therapy Genetic engineering Grinder (biohacking) Human-animal hybrid Life extension Moral enhancement Morphological freedom Posthuman Posthumanization Technological singularity Transhumanism References ↑ body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) Buchanan, Allen.
