  "content": "Control theory Branch of engineering and mathematics This article is about control theory in engineering. For control theory in linguistics, see control (linguistics) . For control theory in psychology and sociology, see control theory (sociology) and Perceptual control theory . Control theory is a field of control engineering and applied mathematics that deals with the control of dynamical systems . The aim is to develop a model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state, while minimizing any delay , overshoot , or steady-state error and ensuring a level of control stability ; often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality . To do this, a controller with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are controllability and observability . Control theory is used in control system engineering to design automation that have revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries, and created new fields such as robotics . Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram . In it the transfer function , also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system. Control theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell . 1 Control theory was further advanced by Edward Routh in 1874, Charles Sturm and in 1895, Adolf Hurwitz , who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria; and from 1922 onwards, the development of PID control theory by Nicolas Minorsky . 2 Although the most direct application of mathematical control theory is its use in control systems engineering (dealing with process control systems for robotics and industry), control theory is routinely applied to problems both the natural and behavioral sciences . As the general theory of feedback systems, control theory is useful wherever feedback occurs, making it important to fields like economics , operations research , and the life sciences . 3 History See also: Control engineering § History Centrifugal governor in a Boulton Watt engine of 1788 Although control systems of various types date back to antiquity, a more formal analysis of the field began with a dynamics analysis of the centrifugal governor , conducted by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1868, entitled On Governors . 4 A centrifugal governor was already used to regulate the velocity of windmills. 5 Maxwell described and analyzed the phenomenon of self-oscillation , in which lags in the system may lead to overcompensation and unstable behavior. This generated a flurry of interest in the topic, during which Maxwell's classmate, Edward John Routh , abstracted Maxwell's results for the general class of linear systems. 6 Independently, Adolf Hurwitz analyzed system stability using differential equations in 1877, resulting in what is now known as the Routh–Hurwitz theorem . 7 8 A notable application of dynamic control was in the area of crewed flight. The Wright brothers made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903, and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Continuous, reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds. By World War II , control theory was becoming an important area of research. Irmgard Flügge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control systems, and applied the bang-bang principle to the development of automatic flight control equipment for aircraft. 9 10 Other areas of application for discontinuous controls included fire-control systems , guidance systems and electronics . Sometimes, mechanical methods are used to improve the stability of systems. For example, ship stabilizers are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally. In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship. The Space Race also depended on accurate spacecraft control, and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics and artificial intelligence. Here, one might say that the goal is to find an internal model that obeys the good regulator theorem . So, for example, in economics, the more accurately a (stock or commodities) trading model represents the actions of the market, the more easily it can control that market (and extract useful work (profits) from it). In AI, an example might be a chatbot modelling the discourse state of humans: the more accurately it can model the human state (e.g. on a telephone voice-support hotline), the better it can manipulate the human (e.g. into performing the corrective actions to resolve the problem that caused the phone call to the help-line). These last two examples take the narrow historical interpretation of control theory as a set of differential equations modeling and regulating kinetic motion, and broaden it into a vast generalization of a regulator interacting with a plant . Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control This section is an excerpt from Control loop § Open-loop and closed-loop . edit Fundamentally, there are two types of control loop: open-loop control (feedforward), and closed-loop control (feedback). In open-loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the process output (or controlled process variable ). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the switching on/off of the boiler, but the controlled variable should be the building temperature, but is not because this is open-loop control of the boiler, which does not give closed-loop control of the temperature. In closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on the process output. In the case of the boiler analogy, this would include a thermostat to monitor the building temperature, and thereby feed back a signal to ensure the controller maintains the building at the temperature set on the thermostat. A closed loop controller therefore has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to give a process output the same as the reference input or set point . For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers. 11 The definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standards Institution is a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero. 12 Likewise; A Feedback Control System is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control. 13 Classical control theory This section is an excerpt from Closed-loop controller . edit Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow. Illustration of a Closed Loop Control consisting of Set Point w ( t ) displaystyle w(t) , Measured Output y m ( t ) displaystyle y_ m (t) , Measured Error e ( t ) displaystyle e(t) , Controller Output u ( t ) displaystyle u(t) , System Input u s ( t ) displaystyle u_ s (t) , Disturbance d ( t ) displaystyle d(t) , and System Output y ( t ) displaystyle y(t) A closed-loop controller or feedback controller is a control loop which incorporates feedback , in contrast to an open-loop controller or non-feedback controller . A closed-loop controller uses feedback to control states or outputs of a dynamical system . Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., voltage applied to an electric motor ) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with sensors and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is fed back as input to the process, closing the loop. 14 In the case of linear feedback systems, a control loop including sensors , control algorithms, and actuators is arranged in an attempt to regulate a variable at a setpoint (SP). An everyday example is the cruise control on a road vehicle; where external influences such as hills would cause speed changes, and the driver has the ability to alter the desired set speed. The PID algorithm in the controller restores the actual speed to the desired speed in an optimum way, with minimal delay or overshoot , by controlling the power output of the vehicle's engine. Control systems that include some sensing of the results they are trying to achieve are making use of feedback and can adapt to varying circumstances to some extent. Open-loop control systems do not make use of feedback, and run only in pre-arranged ways. Closed-loop controllers have the following advantages over open-loop controllers: disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above) guaranteed performance even with model uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact unstable processes can be stabilized reduced sensitivity to parameter variations improved reference tracking performance improved rectification of random fluctuations 15 In some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed feedforward and serves to further improve reference tracking performance. A common closed-loop controller architecture is the PID controller . A basic feedback loop Linear and nonlinear control theory The field of control theory can be divided into two branches: Linear control theory – This applies to systems made of devices which obey the superposition principle , which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input. They are governed by linear differential equations . A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called linear time invariant (LTI) systems. These systems are amenable to powerful frequency domain mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the Laplace transform , Fourier transform , Z transform , Bode plot , root locus , and Nyquist stability criterion . These lead to a description of the system using terms like bandwidth , frequency response , eigenvalues , gain , resonant frequencies , zeros and poles , which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest. Nonlinear control theory – This covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle, and applies to more real-world systems because all real control systems are nonlinear. These systems are often governed by nonlinear differential equations . The few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general, often applying only to narrow categories of systems. These include limit cycle theory, Poincaré maps , Lyapunov stability theorem , and describing functions . Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using numerical methods on computers, for example by simulating their operation using a simulation language . If only solutions near a stable point are of interest, nonlinear systems can often be linearized by approximating them by a linear system using perturbation theory , and linear techniques can be used. 16 Analysis techniques – frequency domain and time domain Mathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories: Frequency domain – In this type the values of the state variables , the mathematical variables representing the system's input, output and feedback are represented as functions of frequency . The input signal and the system's transfer function are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a transform such as the Fourier transform , Laplace transform , or Z transform . The advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics; the differential equations that represent the system are replaced by algebraic equations in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve. However, frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems, as mentioned above. Time-domain state space representation – In this type the values of the state variables are represented as functions of time. With this model, the system being analyzed is represented by one or more differential equations . Since frequency domain techniques are limited to linear systems, time domain is widely used to analyze real-world nonlinear systems. Although these are more difficult to solve, modern computer simulation techniques such as simulation languages have made their analysis routine. In contrast to the frequency-domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain state space representation, citation needed a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the time-domain approach ) provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. State space refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space. 17 18 System interfacing Control systems can be divided into different categories depending on the number of inputs and outputs. Single-input single-output (SISO) – This is the simplest and most common type, in which one output is controlled by one control signal. Examples are the cruise control example above, or an audio power amplifier , in which the control input is the input audio signal and the output drives the loudspeaker . Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) – These are found in more complicated systems. For example, modern large telescopes such as the Keck and MMT have mirrors composed of many separate segments each controlled by an actuator . The shape of the entire mirror is constantly adjusted by a MIMO active optics control system using input from multiple sensors at the focal plane, to compensate for changes in the mirror shape due to thermal expansion, contraction, stresses as it is rotated and distortion of the wavefront due to turbulence in the atmosphere. Complicated systems such as nuclear reactors and human cells are simulated by a computer as large MIMO control systems. Classical SISO system design The scope of classical control theory is limited to single-input and single-output (SISO) system design, except when analyzing for disturbance rejection using a second input. The system analysis is carried out in the time domain using differential equations , in the complex-s domain with the Laplace transform , or in the frequency domain by transforming from the complex-s domain. Many systems may be assumed to have a second order and single variable system response in the time domain. A controller designed using classical theory often requires on-site tuning due to incorrect design approximations. Yet, due to the easier physical implementation of classical controller designs as compared to systems designed using modern control theory, these controllers are preferred in most industrial applications. The most common controllers designed using classical control theory are PID controllers . A less common implementation may include either or both a Lead or Lag filter. The ultimate end goal is to meet requirements typically provided in the time-domain called the step response, or at times in the frequency domain called the open-loop response. The step response characteristics applied in a specification are typically percent overshoot, settling time, etc. The open-loop response characteristics applied in a specification are typically Gain and Phase the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero. If a system in question has an impulse response of x n = 0.5 n u n displaystyle x n =0.5^ n u n then the Z-transform (see this example ), is given by X ( z ) = 1 1 − 0.5 z − 1 displaystyle X(z)= frac 1 1-0.5z^ -1 which has a pole in z = 0.5 displaystyle z=0.5 (zero imaginary part ). This system is BIBO (asymptotically) stable since the pole is inside the unit circle. However, if the impulse response was x n = 1.5 n u n displaystyle x n =1.5^ n u n then the Z-transform is X ( z ) = 1 1 − 1.5 z − 1 displaystyle X(z)= frac 1 1-1.5z^ -1 which has a pole at z = 1.5 displaystyle z=1.5 and is not BIBO stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one. Numerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the root locus , Bode plots or the Nyquist plots . Mechanical changes can make equipment (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships. Cruise ships use antiroll fins that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll. Controllability and observability Main articles: Controllability and Observability Controllability and observability are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable . Observability instead is related to the possibility of observing , through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable. From a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every bad state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behavior in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the eigenvalues of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis. Solutions to problems of an uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors. Control specification Several different control strategies have been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones (PID controller), to others devoted to very particular classes of systems (especially robotics or aircraft cruise control). A control problem can have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present. The controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have R e λ − λ ¯ displaystyle Re lambda - overline lambda , where λ ¯ displaystyle overline lambda is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that R e λ 0 displaystyle Re lambda 0 . Another typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an integrator in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included. Other classical control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system. These include the rise time (the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak overshoot (the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others ( settling time , quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to robustness (see after). Modern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error (IAE, ISA, CQI). Model identification and robustness A control system must always have some robustness property. A robust controller is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This requirement is important, as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations, otherwise, the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible. System identification Further information: System identification The process of determining the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called system identification . This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its transfer function or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations, for example, in the case of a mass-spring-damper system we know that m x ¨ ( t ) = − K x ( t ) − B x ˙ ( t ) displaystyle m ddot x (t)=-Kx(t)- mathrm B dot x (t) . Even assuming that a complete model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called nominal parameters ) are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal. Some advanced control techniques include an on-line identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated ( identified ) while the controller itself is running. In this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues, for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight, the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance. Analysis Analysis of the robustness of a SISO (single input single output) control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using Nyquist and Bode diagrams . Topics include gain and phase the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness. Examples of modern robust control techniques include H-infinity loop-shaping developed by Duncan McFarlane and Keith Glover , Sliding mode control (SMC) developed by Vadim Utkin , and safe protocols designed for control of large heterogeneous populations of electric loads in Smart Power Grid applications. 21 Robust methods aim to achieve robust performance and/or stability in the presence of small modeling errors. Stochastic control deals with control design with uncertainty in the model. In typical stochastic control problems, it is assumed that there exist random noise and disturbances in the model and the controller, and the control design must take into account these random deviations. Adaptive control uses on-line identification of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. Adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the aerospace industry in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field. A hierarchical control system is a type of control system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchical tree . When the links in the tree are implemented by a computer network , then that hierarchical control system is also a form of networked control system . Intelligent control uses various AI computing approaches like artificial neural networks , Bayesian probability , fuzzy logic , 22 machine learning , evolutionary computation and genetic algorithms or a combination of these methods, such as neuro-fuzzy algorithms, to control a dynamic system . Self-organized criticality control may be defined as attempts to interfere in the processes by which the self-organized system dissipates energy. People in systems and control Main article: People in systems and control Many active and historical figures made significant contribution to control theory including Pierre-Simon Laplace invented the Z-transform in his work on probability theory , now used to solve discrete-time control theory problems. The Z-transform is a discrete-time equivalent of the Laplace transform which is named after him. Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control and applied it to automatic aircraft control systems . Alexander Lyapunov in the 1890s marks the beginning of stability theory . Harold S. Black invented the concept of negative feedback amplifiers in 1927. He managed to develop stable negative feedback amplifiers in the 1930s. Harry Nyquist developed the Nyquist stability criterion for feedback systems in the 1930s. Richard Bellman developed dynamic programming in the 1940s. 23 Warren E. Dixon , control theorist and a professor Kyriakos G. Vamvoudakis , developed synchronous reinforcement learning algorithms to solve optimal control and game theoretic problems Andrey Kolmogorov co-developed the Wiener–Kolmogorov filter in 1941. Norbert Wiener co-developed the Wiener–Kolmogorov filter and coined the term cybernetics in the 1940s. John R. Ragazzini introduced digital control and the use of Z-transform in control theory (invented by Laplace) in the 1950s. Lev Pontryagin introduced the maximum principle and the bang-bang principle . Pierre-Louis Lions developed viscosity solutions into stochastic control and optimal control methods. Rudolf E. Kálmán pioneered the state-space approach to systems and control. Introduced the notions of controllability and observability . Developed the Kalman filter for linear estimation. Ali H. Nayfeh who was one of the main contributors to nonlinear control theory and published many books on perturbation methods Jan C. Willems Introduced the concept of dissipativity, as a generalization of Lyapunov function to input/state/output systems. The construction of the storage function, as the analogue of a Lyapunov function is called, led to the study of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) in control theory. He pioneered the behavioral approach to mathematical systems theory.
