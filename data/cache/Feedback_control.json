This then reoccurs in a circular fashion as the water level fluctuates. 5 Centrifugal governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the 17th century. In 1788, James Watt designed his first centrifugal governor following a suggestion from his business partner Matthew Boulton , for use in the steam engines of their production. Early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion , and were used for pumping water – an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed, but the use of steam engines for other applications called for more precise control of the speed. In 1868 , James Clerk Maxwell wrote a famous paper, On governors , that is widely considered a classic in feedback control theory. 6 This was a landmark paper on control theory and the mathematics of feedback. The verb phrase to feed back , in the sense of returning to an earlier position in a mechanical process, was in use in the US by the 1860s, 7 8 and in 1909, Nobel laureate Karl Ferdinand Braun used the term feed-back as a noun to refer to (undesired) coupling between components of an electronic circuit . 9 By the end of 1912, researchers using early electronic amplifiers ( audions ) had discovered that deliberately coupling part of the output signal back to the input circuit would boost the amplification (through regeneration ), but would also cause the audion to howl or sing. 10 This action of feeding back of the signal from output to input gave rise to the use of the term feedback as a distinct word by 1920. 10 The development of cybernetics from the 1940s onwards was centred around the study of circular causal feedback mechanisms. Over the years there has been some dispute as to the best definition of feedback. According to cybernetician Ashby (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in the principles of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of circularity of action , which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more practical aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection. n /ref> , ' /> Practical experimenters object to the mathematician's definition, pointing out that this would force them to say that feedback was present in the ordinary pendulum ... between its position and its momentum—a feedback that, from the practical point of view, is somewhat mystical. To this the mathematician retorts that if feedback is to be considered present only when there is an actual wire or nerve to represent it, then the theory becomes chaotic and riddled with irrelevancies. 11 : 54 Focusing on uses in management theory, Ramaprasad (1983) defines feedback generally as ...information about the gap between the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter that is used to alter the gap in some way . He emphasizes that the information by itself is not feedback unless translated into action. 12 Types Positive and negative feedback Main articles: Negative feedback and Positive feedback Maintaining a desired system performance despite disturbance using negative feedback to reduce system error An example of a negative feedback loop with goals A positive feedback loop example Positive feedback: If the signal feedback from output is in phase with the input signal, the feedback is called positive feedback. Negative feedback: If the signal feedback is out of phase by 180° with respect to the input signal, the feedback is called negative feedback. As an example of negative feedback, the diagram might represent a cruise control system in a car that matches a target speed such as the speed limit. The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a speedometer . The error signal is the difference of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). The controller interprets the speed to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the change of road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimising the changing slope. The terms positive and negative were first applied to feedback prior to WWII. The idea of positive feedback already existed in the 1920s when the regenerative circuit was made. 13 Friis and Jensen (1924) described this circuit in a set of electronic amplifiers as a case where the feed-back action is positive in contrast to negative feed-back action, which they mentioned only in passing. 14 Harold Stephen Black 's classic 1934 paper first details the use of negative feedback in electronic amplifiers. According to Black: nH.S. Black, Stabilized feed-back amplifiers , Electrical Engineering , vol. 53, pp. nbsp;114–120, January 1934. /ref> , ' /> Positive feed-back increases the gain of the amplifier, negative feed-back reduces it. 15 According to Mindell (2002) confusion in the terms arose shortly after this: , ' /> ... Friis and Jensen had made the same distinction Black used between positive feed-back and negative feed-back , based not on the sign of the feedback itself but rather on its effect on the amplifier's gain. In contrast, Nyquist and Bode, when they built on Black's work, referred to negative feedback as that with the sign reversed. Black had trouble convincing others of the utility of his invention in part because confusion existed over basic matters of definition. 13 : 121 Even before these terms were being used, James Clerk Maxwell had described their concept through several kinds of component motions associated with the centrifugal governors used in steam engines. He distinguished those that lead to a continued increase in a disturbance or the amplitude of a wave or oscillation, from those that lead to a decrease of the same quality. 16 Terminology The terms positive and negative feedback are defined in different ways within different disciplines. the change of the gap between reference and actual values of a parameter or trait, based on whether the gap is widening (positive) or narrowing (negative). 12 the valence of the action or effect that alters the gap, based on whether it makes the recipient or observer happy (positive) or unhappy (negative). 17 The two definitions may be confusing, like when an incentive (reward) is used to boost poor performance (narrow a gap). Referring to definition 1, some authors use alternative terms, replacing positive and negative with self-reinforcing and self-correcting , 18 reinforcing and balancing , 19 discrepancy-enhancing and discrepancy-reducing 20 or regenerative and degenerative 21 respectively. And for definition 2, some authors promote describing the action or effect as positive and negative reinforcement or punishment rather than feedback. 12 22 Yet even within a single discipline an example of feedback can be called either positive or negative, depending on how values are measured or referenced. 23 This confusion may arise because feedback can be used to provide information or motivate , and often has both a qualitative and a quantitative component. As Connellan and Zemke (1993) put it: Thomas K. Connellan and Ron Zemke, Sustaining Knock Your Socks Off Service AMACOM, 1 July 1993. /ref> , ' /> Quantitative feedback tells us how much and how many. Qualitative feedback tells us how good, bad or indifferent. 24 : 102 Limitations of negative and positive feedback While simple systems can sometimes be described as one or the other type, many systems with feedback loops cannot be shoehorned into either type, and this is especially true when multiple loops are present. , ' /> When there are only two parts joined so that each affects the other, the properties of the feedback give important and useful information about the properties of the whole. But when the parts rise to even as few as four, if every one affects the other three, then twenty circuits can be traced through them; and knowing the properties of all the twenty circuits does not give complete information about the system. 11 : 54 Other types of feedback In general, feedback systems can have many signals fed back and the feedback loop frequently contain mixtures of positive and negative feedback where positive and negative feedback can dominate at different frequencies or different points in the state space of a system. The term bipolar feedback has been coined to refer to biological systems where positive and negative feedback systems can interact, the output of one affecting the input of another, and vice versa. 25 Some systems with feedback can have very complex behaviors such as chaotic behaviors in non-linear systems, while others have much more predictable behaviors, such as those that are used to make and design digital systems. Feedback is used extensively in digital systems. For example, binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it. Applications Mathematics and dynamical systems Main articles: Dynamical system , Chaos theory , Edge of chaos , and Control theory Feedback can give rise to incredibly complex behaviors. The Mandelbrot set (black) within a continuously systems can be made stable, responsive or held constant. It is shown that dynamical systems with a feedback experience an adaptation to the edge of chaos . 26 Physics Physical systems present feedback through the mutual interactions of its parts. Feedback is also relevant for the regulation of experimental conditions, noise reduction, and signal control. 27 The thermodynamics of feedback-controlled systems has intrigued physicist since the Maxwell's demon , with recent advances on the consequences for entropy reduction and performance increase. 28 29 Biology Main article: Biological interaction See also: Homeostasis and Allostasis In biological systems such as organisms , ecosystems , or the biosphere , most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions. The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. An example of this is insulin oscillations . Biological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, both positive and negative. As in other contexts, positive and negative do not imply that the feedback causes good or bad effects. A negative feedback loop is one that tends to slow down a process, whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it. The mirror neurons are part of a social feedback system, when an observed action is mirrored by the brain—like a self-performed action. Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted molecules that act as mediators; failure of key feedback mechanisms in cancer disrupts tissue function. 30 In an injured or infected tissue, inflammatory mediators elicit feedback responses in cells, which alter gene expression, and change the groups of molecules expressed and secreted, including molecules that induce diverse cells to cooperate and restore tissue structure and function. This type of feedback is important because it enables coordination of immune responses and recovery from infections and injuries. During cancer, key elements of this feedback fail. This disrupts tissue function and immunity. 31 32 Mechanisms of feedback were first elucidated in bacteria, where a nutrient elicits changes in some of their metabolic functions. 33 Feedback is also central to the operations of genes and gene regulatory networks . Repressor (see Lac repressor ) and activator proteins are used to create genetic operons , which were identified by François Jacob and Jacques Monod in 1961 as feedback loops . 34 These feedback loops may be positive (as in the case of the coupling between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial cell), or negative (as is often the case in metabolic consumption). On a larger scale, feedback can have a stabilizing effect on animal populations even when profoundly affected by external changes, although time lags in feedback response can give rise to predator-prey cycles . 35 In zymology , feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct product(s) or downstream metabolite(s) in the metabolic pathway (see Allosteric regulation ). The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is largely controlled by positive and negative feedback, much of which is still unknown. In psychology , the body receives a stimulus from the environment or internally that causes the release of hormones . Release of hormones then may cause more of those hormones to be released, causing a positive feedback loop. This cycle is also found in certain behaviour. For example, shame loops occur in people who blush easily. When they realize that they are blushing, they become even more embarrassed, which leads to further blushing, and so on. 36 Climate science Main article: Climate change feedback Some effects of global warming can either enhance ( positive feedbacks ) or inhibit ( negative feedbacks ) warming. 37 38 The climate system is characterized by strong positive and negative feedback loops between processes that affect the state of the atmosphere, ocean, and land. A simple example is the ice–albedo positive feedback loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground (of lower albedo ), which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt. Control theory Main article: Control theory Feedback is extensively used in control theory, using a variety of methods including state space (controls) , full state feedback , and so forth. In the context of control theory, feedback is traditionally assumed to specify negative feedback . 39 Further information: PID controller The most common general-purpose controller using a control-loop feedback mechanism is a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Heuristically, the terms of a PID controller can be interpreted as corresponding to time: the proportional term depends on the present error, the integral term on the accumulation of past errors, and the derivative term is a prediction of future error, based on current rate of change. 40 Education For feedback in the educational context, see corrective feedback . Mechanical engineering In ancient times, the float valve was used to regulate the flow of water in Greek and Roman water clocks ; similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in a carburettor and also used to regulate tank water level in the flush toilet . The Dutch inventor Cornelius Drebbel (1572–1633) built thermostats (c1620) to control the temperature of chicken incubators and chemical furnaces. In 1745, the windmill was improved by blacksmith Edmund Lee, who added a fantail to keep the face of the windmill pointing into the wind. In 1787, Tom Mead regulated the rotation speed of a windmill by using a centrifugal pendulum to adjust the distance between the bedstone and the runner stone (i.e., to adjust the load). The use of the centrifugal governor by James Watt in 1788 to regulate the speed of his steam engine was one factor leading to the Industrial Revolution . Steam engines also use float valves and pressure release valves as mechanical regulation devices. A mathematical analysis of Watt's governor was done by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868. 16 The Great Eastern was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in 1866 by John McFarlane Gray . Joseph Farcot coined the word servo in 1873 to describe steam-powered steering systems. Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns. Elmer Ambrose Sperry of the Sperry Corporation designed the first autopilot in 1912. Nicolas Minorsky published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in 1922 and described the PID controller . 41 Internal combustion engines of the late 20th century employed mechanical feedback mechanisms such as the vacuum timing advance but mechanical feedback was replaced by electronic engine management systems once small, robust and powerful single-chip microcontrollers became affordable. Electronic engineering The simplest form of a feedback amplifier can be represented by the ideal block diagram made up of unilateral elements . 42 The use of feedback is widespread in the design of electronic components such as amplifiers , oscillators , and stateful logic circuit elements such as flip-flops and counters . Electronic feedback systems are also very commonly used to control mechanical, thermal and other physical processes. If the signal is inverted on its way round the control loop, the system is said to have negative feedback ; 43 otherwise, the feedback is said to be positive . Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the stability and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes. This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it. When this happens, the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in over-correction, causing the output to oscillate or hunt . 44 While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour, this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators. Harry Nyquist at Bell Labs derived the Nyquist stability criterion for determining the stability of feedback systems. An easier method, but less general, is to use Bode plots developed by Hendrik Bode to determine the gain the simple ones are commonly called latches . 51 52 Using this terminology, a latch is level-sensitive, whereas a flip-flop is edge-sensitive. That is, when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent, while a flip flop's output only changes on a single type (positive going or negative going) of clock edge. Software Feedback loops provide generic mechanisms for controlling the running, maintenance, and evolution of software and computing systems. 53 Feedback-loops are important models in the engineering of adaptive software, as they define the behaviour of the interactions among the control elements over the adaptation process, to guarantee system properties at run-time. Feedback loops and foundations of control theory have been successfully applied to computing systems. 54 In particular, they have been applied to the development of products such as IBM Db2 and IBM Tivoli . From a software perspective, the autonomic (MAPE, monitor analyze plan execute) loop proposed by researchers of IBM is another valuable contribution to the application of feedback loops to the control of dynamic properties and the design and evolution of autonomic software systems. 55 56 Software Development Main article: Software review User interface design Main article: User interface design Feedback is also a useful design principle for designing user interfaces . Video feedback Video feedback is the video equivalent of acoustic feedback . It involves a loop between a video camera input and a video output, e.g., a television screen or monitor . Aiming the camera at the display produces a complex video image based on the feedback. 57 Human resource management Main article: performance appraisal /span>icon span typeof= mw:Entity data-parsoid= > /span> , '> This section is empty.
