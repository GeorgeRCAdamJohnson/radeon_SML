Autonomy is enabled by advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) of varying capacity. Related technology includes advanced software, maps, vehicle changes, and outside vehicle support. Autonomy presents varying issues for road, air, and marine travel. Roads present the most significant complexity given the unpredictability of the driving environment, including diverse road designs, driving conditions, traffic, obstacles, and geographical/cultural differences. 7 Autonomy implies that the vehicle is responsible for all perception, monitoring, and control functions. 8 SAE autonomy levels Main article: Self-driving car § Classifications Further information: Automatic train operation § Grades of automation The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) classifies road vehicle autonomy in six levels: 9 10 0: No automation. 1: Driver assistance, the vehicle controls steering or speed autonomously in specific circumstances. 2: Partial automation, the vehicle controls both steering and speed autonomously in specific circumstances. 3: Conditional automation, the vehicle controls both steering and speed under normal environmental conditions, but requires the driver to be ready to take control in other circumstances. 4: High automation, the vehicle travels autonomously under normal environmental conditions, not requiring driver oversight. 5: Full autonomy, where the vehicle can complete travel autonomously in any environmental conditions. Level 0 refers, for instance, to vehicles without adaptive cruise control . Level 1 and 2 refer to vehicles where one part of the driving task is performed by the ADAS under the responsibility/liability of the driver. From level 3, the driver can transfer the driving task to the vehicle, but the driver must assume control when the ADAS reaches its limits. For instance an automated traffic jam pilot can drive in a traffic jam , but otherwise passes control to the driver. Level 5 refers to a vehicle that can handle any situation. 11 Technology Software Autonomous vehicle software generally contains several different modules that work together to enable self-driving capabilities. 12 13 14 The perception module ingests and processes data from various sensors, such cameras , LIDAR , RADAR , and ultrasonic SONAR , to create a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's surroundings. 15 The localization module uses 3D point cloud data, GPS , IMU , and mapping information to determine the vehicle's precise position, including its orientation, velocity, and angular rate . 16 17 The planning module takes inputs from both perception and localization to compute actions to take, such as velocity and steering angle outputs. 18 These modules are typically supported by machine learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks , 19 which enable the vehicle to detect objects, interpret traffic patterns, 20 and make real-time decisions. 21 Furthermore, modern autonomous driving systems increasingly employ sensor fusion techniques that combine data from multiple sensors to improve accuracy and reliability in different environmental conditions. 22 23 Perception The perception system is responsible for observing the environment. It must identify everything that could affect the trip, including other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, their movements, road conditions, obstacles, and other issues. 24 Various makers use cameras, radar , lidar , sonar , and microphones that can collaboratively minimize errors. 24 25 Navigation Navigation systems are a necessary element in autonomous vehicles. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used for navigation by air, water, and land vehicles, particularly for off-road navigation. For road vehicles, two approaches are prominent. One is to use maps that hold data about lanes and intersections, relying on the vehicle's perception system to fill in the details. The other is to use highly detailed maps that reduce the scope of real-time decision-making but require significant maintenance as the environment evolves. 19 Some systems crowdsource their map updates, using the vehicles themselves to update the map to reflect changes such as construction or traffic used by the entire vehicle fleet. 26 Another potential source of information is the environment itself. Traffic data may be supplied by roadside monitoring systems and used to route vehicles to best use a limited road system. 27 Additionally, modern GNSS enhancement technologies, such as real-time kinematic (RTK) and precise point positioning (PPP), enhance the accuracy of vehicle positioning to sub-meter level precision, which is crucial for autonomous navigation and decision-making. 28 History Automated vehicles in European Union legislation refer specifically to road vehicles (car, truck, or bus). 29 For those vehicles, a specific difference is legally defined between advanced driver-assistance system and autonomous/automated vehicles, based on liability differences. AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety tested two automatic emergency braking systems: some designed to prevent crashes and others that aim to make a crash less severe. The test looked at popular models like the 2016 Volvo XC90 , Subaru Legacy , Lincoln MKX , Honda Civic , and Volkswagen Passat . Researchers tested how well each system stopped when approaching moving and nonmoving targets. It found that systems capable of preventing crashes reduced vehicle speeds by twice that of the systems designed to mitigate crash severity. When the two test vehicles traveled within 30 mph of each other, even those designed to lessen crash severity avoided crashes 60 percent of the time. 30 Sartre The SAfe Road TRains for the Environment (Sartre) project's goal was to enable platooning, in which a line of cars and trucks (a train ) follow a human-driven vehicle. Trains were predicted to provide comfort and allow the following vehicles to travel safely to a destination. Human drivers encountering a train could join and delegate driving to the human driver. 31 Tests Self-driving Uber vehicles were tested in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The tests were paused after an autonomous car killed a woman in Arizona. 32 33 Automated busses have been tested in California. 34 In San Diego, California, an automated bus test used magnetic markers. The longitudinal control of automated truck platoons used millimeter wave radio and radar. Waymo and Tesla have conducted tests. Tesla FSD allows drivers to enter a destination and let the car take over. Risks and liabilities See also: Computer security § Automobiles , and Autonomous car liability Ford offers Blue Cruise, technology that allows geofenced cars to drive autonomously. 35 Drivers are directed to stay attentive, and safety warnings are implemented to alert the driver when corrective action is needed. 36 Tesla, Incorporated has one recorded incident that resulted in a fatality involving the automated driving system in the Tesla Model S. 37 The accident report reveals the accident was a result of the driver being inattentive and the autopilot system not recognizing the obstruction ahead. 37 Tesla has also had multiple instances where the vehicle crashed into a garage door. According to the book The Driver in the Driverless Car: How Your Technology Choices Create the Future, Tesla automatically performs an update overnight. The morning after the update, the driver used his app to summon his car, and it crashed into his garage door. Another flaw with automated driving systems is that unpredictable events, such as weather or the driving behavior of others, may cause fatal accidents due to sensors that monitor the surroundings of the vehicle not being able to provide corrective action. 36 To overcome some of the challenges for automated driving systems, novel methodologies based on virtual testing, traffic flow simulation and digital prototypes have been proposed, 38 especially when novel algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence approaches are employed which require extensive training and validation data sets. Implementing automated driving systems poses the possibility of changing built environments in urban areas, such as expanding the suburban regions due to the increased ease of mobility. 39 Challenges Around 2015, several self-driving car companies including Nissan and Toyota promised self-driving cars by 2020. However, the predictions turned out to be far too optimistic. 40 There are still many obstacles in developing fully autonomous Level 5 vehicles, which is the ability to operate in any conditions. Currently, companies are focused on Level 4 automation, which is able to operate under certain environmental circumstances. 40 There is still debate about what an autonomous vehicle should look like. For example, whether to incorporate lidar to autonomous driving systems is still being argued. Some researchers have come up with algorithms using camera-only data that achieve the performance that rival those of lidar. On the other hand, camera-only data sometimes draw inaccurate bounding boxes, and thus lead to poor predictions. This is due to the nature of superficial information that stereo cameras provide, whereas incorporating lidar gives autonomous vehicles precise distance to each point on the vehicle. 40 Technical challenges Software Integration: Because of the large number of sensors and safety processes required by autonomous vehicles, software integration remains a challenging task. A robust autonomous vehicle should ensure that the integration of hardware and software can recover from component failures. 41 Prediction and trust among autonomous vehicles: Fully autonomous cars should be able to anticipate the actions of other cars like humans do. Human drivers are great at predicting other drivers' behaviors, even with a small amount of data such as eye contact or hand gestures. In the first place, the cars should agree on traffic rules, whose turn it is to drive in an intersection, and so on. This scales into a larger issue when there exists both human-operated cars and self-driving cars due to more uncertainties. A robust autonomous vehicle is expected to improve on understanding the environment better to address this issue. 41 Scaling up: The coverage of autonomous vehicles testing could not be accurate enough. In cases where heavy traffic and obstruction exist, it requires faster response time or better tracking algorithms from the autonomous vehicles. In cases where unseen objects are encountered, it is important that the algorithms are able to track these objects and avoid collisions. 41 These features require numerous sensors, many of which rely on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) to maintain a small size, high efficiency, and low cost. Foremost among MEMS sensors in vehicles are accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure acceleration around multiple orthogonal axes—critical to detecting and controlling the vehicle's motion. Societal challenges One critical step to achieve the implementation of autonomous vehicles is the acceptance by the general public. It provides guidelines for the automobile industry to improve their design and technology. Studies have shown that many people believe that using autonomous vehicles is safer, which underlines the necessity for the automobile companies to assure that autonomous vehicles improve safety benefits. The TAM research model breaks down important factors that affect the consumer's acceptance into: usefulness, ease to use, trust, and social influence. 42 The usefulness factor studies whether or not autonomous vehicles are useful in that they provide benefits that save consumers' time and make their lives simpler. How well the consumers believe autonomous vehicles will be useful compared to other forms of transportation solutions is a determining factor. 42 The ease to use factor studies the user-friendliness of the autonomous vehicles. While the notion that consumers care more about ease to use than safety has been challenged. It still remains an important factor that has indirect effects on the public's intention to use autonomous vehicles. 42 The trust factor studies the safety, data privacy and security protection of autonomous vehicles. A more trusted system has a positive impact on the consumer's decision to use autonomous vehicles. 42 The social influence factor studies whether the influence of others would influence consumer's likelihood of having autonomous vehicles. Studies have shown that the social influence factor is positively related to behavioral intention. This might be due to the fact that cars traditionally serve as a status symbol that represents one's intent to use and his social environment. 42 Regulatory challenges See also: Regulation of self-driving cars Real-time testing of autonomous vehicles is an inevitable part of the process. At the same time, vehicular automation regulators are faced with challenges to protect public safety and yet allow autonomous vehicle companies to test their products. Groups representing autonomous vehicle companies are resisting most regulations, whereas groups representing vulnerable road users and traffic safety are pushing for regulatory barriers. To improve traffic safety, the regulators are encouraged to find a middle ground that protects the public from immature technology while allowing autonomous vehicle companies to test the implementation of their systems. 43 There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety regulatory knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics. 44 Ground vehicles Further information: Unmanned ground vehicle In some countries, specific laws and regulations apply to road traffic motor vehicles (such as cars, bus and trucks) while other laws and regulations apply to other ground vehicles such as tram, train or automated guided vehicles making them to operate in different environments and conditions. Road traffic vehicles An automated driving system is defined in a proposed amendment to Article 1 of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic : /ref> , ' > (ab) Automated driving system refers to a vehicle system that uses both hardware and software to exercise dynamic control of a vehicle on a sustained basis. (ac) Dynamic control refers to carrying out all the real-time operational and tactical functions required to move the vehicle. This includes controlling the vehicle's lateral and longitudinal motion, monitoring the road environment, responding to events in the road traffic environment, and planning and signalling for manoeuvres. 45 This amendment will enter into force on 14 July 2022, unless it is rejected before 13 January 2022. 46 SMMT publishes guiding principles for marketing automated vehicles, SMMT, 22 November 2021 /ref> , ' /> An automated driving feature must be described sufficiently clearly so that it is distinguished from an assisted driving feature. — SMMT 47 , ' /> There are two clear states – a vehicle is either assisted with a driver being supported by technology or automated where the technology is effectively and safely replacing the driver. — SMMT 47 Ground vehicles employing automation and teleoperation include shipyard gantries, mining trucks, bomb-disposal robots, robotic insects, and driverless tractors . There are many autonomous and semi-autonomous ground vehicles being made for the purpose of transporting passengers. One such example is the free-ranging on grid ( FROG ) technology which consists of autonomous vehicles, a magnetic track and a supervisory system. The FROG system is deployed for industrial purposes in factory sites and has been in use since 1999 on the ParkShuttle , a PRT -style public transport system in the city of Capelle aan den IJssel to connect the Rivium business park with the neighboring city of Rotterdam (where the route terminates at the Kralingse Zoom metro station). The system experienced a crash in 2005 48 that proved to be caused by a human error. 49 Applications for automation in ground vehicles include the following: Vehicle tracking system system ESITrack, Lojack . Rear-view alarm, to detect obstacles behind. Anti-lock braking system (ABS) (also Emergency Braking Assistance ( EBA )), often coupled with Electronic brake force distribution (EBD), which prevents the brakes from locking and losing traction while braking. This shortens stopping distances in most cases and, more importantly, allows the driver to steer the vehicle while braking. Traction control system (TCS) actuates brakes or reduces throttle to restore traction if driven wheels begin to spin. Four wheel drive (AWD) with a centre differential. Distributing power to all four wheels lessens the chances of wheel spin. It also suffers less from oversteer and understeer . Electronic Stability Control (ESC) (also known for Mercedes-Benz proprietary Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR) and Electronic differential lock (EDL)). Uses various sensors to intervene when the car senses a possible loss of control. The car's control unit can reduce power from the engine and even apply the brakes on individual wheels to prevent the car from understeering or oversteering . Dynamic steering response (DSR) corrects the rate of power steering system to adapt it to vehicle's speed and road conditions. Research is ongoing and prototypes of autonomous ground vehicles exist. Cars See also: Self-driving car Extensive automation for cars focuses on either introducing robotic cars or modifying modern car designs to be semi-autonomous. Semi-autonomous designs could be implemented sooner as they rely less on technology that is still at the forefront of research. An example is the dual mode monorail. Groups such as RUF (Denmark) and TriTrack (USA) are working on projects consisting of specialized private cars that are driven manually on normal roads but also that dock onto a monorail/guideway along which they are driven autonomously. As a method of automating cars without extensively modifying the cars as much as a robotic car , Automated highway systems (AHS) aims to construct lanes on highways that would be equipped with, for example, magnets to guide the vehicles. Automation vehicles have auto-brakes named as Auto Vehicles Braking System (AVBS). Highway computers would manage the traffic and direct the cars to avoid crashes. In 2006, The European Commission has established a smart car development program called the Intelligent Car Flagship Initiative . 50 The goals of that program include: Adaptive cruise control Lane departure warning system Project AWAKE for drowsy drivers There are further uses for automation in relation to cars. These include: Assured Clear Distance Ahead Adaptive headlamps Advanced Automatic Collision Notification , such as OnStar Intelligent Parking Assist System Automatic Parking Automotive night vision with pedestrian detection Blind spot monitoring Driver Monitoring System Robotic car or self-driving car which may result in less-stressed drivers , higher efficiency (the driver can do something else), increased safety and less pollution (e.g. via completely automated fuel control) Precrash system Safe speed governing Traffic sign recognition Following another car on a motorway – enhanced or adaptive cruise control, as used by Ford Motor Company and Vauxhall 51 Distance control assist – as developed by Nissan 52 Dead man's switch – there is a move to introduce deadman's braking into automotive application, primarily heavy vehicles, and there may also be a need to add penalty switches to cruise controls . Singapore also announced a set of provisional national standards on January 31, 2019, to guide the autonomous vehicle industry. The standards, known as Technical Reference 68 (TR68), will promote the safe deployment of fully driverless vehicles in Singapore, according to a joint press release by Enterprise Singapore (ESG), Land Transport Authority (LTA), Standards Development Organisation and Singapore Standards Council (SSC). 53 Shuttle Parkshuttle Navya Autonom Shuttle Easymile EZ10 King Long Apolong Since 1999, the 12-seat/10-standing ParkShuttle has been operating on an 1.8 kilometres (1.1 mi) exclusive right of way in the city of Capelle aan den IJssel in The Netherlands. The system uses small magnets in the road surface to allow the vehicle to determine its position. The use of shared autonomous vehicles was trialed around 2012 in a hospital car park in Portugal. 54 From 2012 to 2016, the European Union funded CityMobil2 project examined the use of shared autonomous vehicles and passenger experience including short term trials in seven cities. This project led to the development of the EasyMile EZ10. 55 In the 2010s, self-driving shuttle became able to run in mixed traffic without the need for embedded guidance markers. 56 So far the focus has been on low speed, 20 miles per hour (32 km/h) , with short, fixed routes for the last mile of journeys. This means issues of collision avoidance and safety are significantly less challenging than those for automated cars, which seek to match the performance of conventional vehicles. Many trials have been undertaken, mainly on quiet roads with little traffic or on public pathways or private roadways and specialised test sites. citation needed The capacity of different models varies significantly, between 6-seats and 20-seats. (Above this size there are conventional buses that have driverless technology installed.) In December 2016, the Jacksonville Transportation Authority has announced its intention to replace the Jacksonville Skyway monorail with driverless vehicles that would run on the existing elevated superstructure as well as continue onto ordinary roads. 57 The project has since been named the Ultimate Urban Circulator or U2C and testing has been carried out on shuttles from six different manufacturers. The cost of the project is estimated at $379 million. 58 In January 2017, it was announced the ParkShuttle system in the Netherlands will be renewed and expanded including extending the route network beyond the exclusive right of way so vehicles will run in mixed traffic on ordinary roads. 59 The plans were delayed and the extension into mixed traffic was expected in 2021. 60 In July 2018, Baidu stated it had built 100 of its 8-seat Apolong model, with plans for commercial sales. 61 As of July 2021, they had not gone into volume production. In August 2020, it was reported there were 25 autonomous shuttle manufacturers, 62 including the 2GetThere , Local Motors , Navya , Baidu , Easymile , Toyota and Ohmio. In December 2020, Toyota showcased its 20-passenger e-Palette vehicle, which is due to be used at the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games . 63 Toyota announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025. 64 In January 2021, Navya released an investor report which predicted global autonomous shuttle sales will reach 12,600 units by 2025, with a market value of EUR 1.7 billion. 65 In June 2021, Chinese maker Yutong claimed to have delivered 100 models of its 10-seat Xiaoyu 2.0 autonomous bus for use in Zhengzhou . Testing has been carried out in a number of cities since 2019 with trials open to the public planned for July 2021. 66 Self-driving shuttles are already in use on some private roads, such as at the Yutong factory in Zhengzhou where they are used to transport workers between buildings of the world's largest bus factory. 67 In Hong Kong, the police and other workers use driverless vehicles. 68 Trials A large number of trials have been conducted since 2016, with most involving only one vehicle on a short route for a short period of time and with an onboard conductor. The purpose of the trials has been to both provide technical data and to familiarize the public with the driverless technology. A 2021 survey of over 100 shuttle experiments across Europe concluded that low speed – 15–20 kilometres per hour (9.3–12.4 mph) – was the major barrier to implementation of autonomous shuttle buses. The current cost of the vehicles at €280,000 and the need for onboard attendants were also issues. 69 html body.mediawiki This list is incomplete ; you can help by adding missing items .

Each vehicle could carry 20 people or 4 wheelchairs and had a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) . 117 (The event also used 200 driver operated variants called the Accessible People Movers (APM) , to take athletes to their events.) On August 27, 2021, Toyota suspended all e-Pallete services at the Paralympics after a vehicle collided with and injured a visually impaired pedestrian, 118 and restarted on August 31 with improved safety measures. 119 Hino Poncho Long tuned by Nippon Mobility in Shinjuku , Tokyo In November 2021, Tokyo Metropolitan Government started three trials. As one of the three, a lead contractor Keio Dentetsu Bus was planned to operate in the central area of the megalopolis . 120 Vehicle names are in quotes Buses The United Kingdom's first autonomous bus, currently on trial with Stagecoach Manchester Autonomous buses are proposed, as well as self-driving cars and trucks. Grade 2 level automated minibusses were trialed for a few weeks in Stockholm. 121 122 China has a small fleet of self-driving public buses in the tech district of Shenzhen, Guangdong. 123 The first autonomous bus trial in the United Kingdom commenced in mid-2019, with an Alexander Dennis Enviro200 MMC single-decker bus modified with autonomous software from Fusion Processing able to operate in driverless mode within Stagecoach Manchester 's Sharston bus depot, performing tasks such as driving to the washing station, refueling point and then parking at a dedicated parking space in the depot. 124 Passenger-carrying driverless bus trials in Scotland commenced in January 2023, with a fleet of five identical vehicles to the Manchester trial used on a 14 miles (23 km) Stagecoach Fife park-and-ride route across the Forth Road Bridge , from the north bank of the Forth to Edinburgh Park station . 125 126 Another autonomous trial in Oxfordshire , England, which uses a battery electric Fiat Ducato minibus on a circular service to Milton Park , operated by FirstBus with support from Fusion Processing, Oxfordshire County Council and the University of the West of England , entered full passenger service also in January 2023.

Companies such as Suncor Energy , a Canadian energy company, and Rio Tinto Group were among the first to replace human-operated trucks with driverless commercial trucks run by computers. 135 In April 2016, trucks from major manufacturers including Volvo and the Daimler Company completed a week of autonomous driving across Europe, organized by the Dutch, in an effort to get self-driving trucks on the road. With developments in self-driving trucks progressing, U.S. self-driving truck sales is expected to reach 60,000 by 2035 according to a report released by IHS Incorporated in June 2016. 136 As reported in June 1995 in Popular Science magazine, self-driving trucks were being developed for combat convoys, whereby only the lead truck would be driven by a human and the following trucks would rely on satellite, an inertial guidance system and ground-speed sensors. 137 Caterpillar Incorporated made early developments in 2013 with the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University to improve efficiency and reduce cost at various mining and construction sites. 138 In Europe, the Safe Road Trains for the Environment is such an approach. From PWC's Strategy Report, 139 self driving trucks will be the source of concern around how this technology will impact around 3 million truck drivers in the US, as well as 4 million employees in support of the trucking economy in gas stations, restaurants, bars and hotels. At the same time, some companies like Starsky, are aiming for Level 3 Autonomy, which would see the driver playing a control role around the truck's environment. The company's project, remote truck driving, would give truck drivers a greater work-life balance, enabling them to avoid long periods away from their home. This would however provoke a potential mismatch between the driver's skills with the technological redefinition of the job. Companies that buy driverless trucks could massively cut costs: human drivers would no longer be required, companies' liabilities due to truck accidents would diminish, and productivity would increase (as the driverless truck doesn't need to rest). The usage of self driving trucks will go hand in hand with the use of real-time data to optimize both efficiency and productivity of the service delivered, as a way to tackle traffic congestion for example. Driverless trucks could enable new business models that would see deliveries shift from day time to night time or time slots in which traffic is less heavily dense. Suppliers Company Details Waymo Semi In March 2018, Waymo , the automated vehicle company spun off from Google parent company Alphabet Incorporated , announced it was applying its technology to semi trucks. In the announcement, Waymo noted it would be using automated trucks to move freight related to Google's data centers in the Atlanta , Georgia area. The trucks will be manned and operated on public roads. 140 Uber Semi In October 2016, Uber completed the first driverless operation of an automated truck on public roads, delivering a trailer of Budweiser beer from Fort Collins, Colorado to Colorado Springs. 141 The run was completed at night on Interstate 25 after extensive testing and system improvements in cooperation with the Colorado State Police. The truck had a human in the cab but not sitting in the driver's seat, while the Colorado State Police provided a rolling closure of the highway. 142 At the time, Uber's automated truck was based primarily on technology developed by Otto , which Uber acquired in August 2016. 143 In March 2018, Uber announced it was using its automated trucks to deliver freight in Arizona, while also leveraging the UberFreight app to find and dispatch loads. 144 Embark Semi In February 2018, Embark Trucks announced it had completed the first cross-country trip of an automated semi, driving 2,400 miles from Los Angeles, California to Jacksonville, Florida on Interstate 10. 145 This followed a November 2017 anno",
