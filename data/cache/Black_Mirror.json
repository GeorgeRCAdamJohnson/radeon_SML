Most episodes are set in near-future dystopias containing sci-fi technology—a type of speculative fiction . The series is inspired by The Twilight Zone and uses the themes of technology and media to comment on contemporary social issues. Most episodes are written by Brooker with involvement by the executive producer Annabel Jones . There are 33 episodes in seven series and one special, in addition to the interactive film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch (2018). The first two series aired on the British network Channel 4 in 2011 and 2013, as did the 2014 special White Christmas . The programme then moved to Netflix , where five further series aired in 2016, 2017, 2019, 2023, and 2025. Two related webisode series were produced by Netflix, and a companion book to the first four series, Inside Black Mirror , was published in 2018. Soundtracks to many episodes have been released as albums. Black Mirror is considered by some reviewers to be one of the best television series of the 2010s, while some critics have found the formulaic morality themes of the series obvious or have cited declining quality. The programme won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie three times consecutively for San Junipero , USS Callister and Bandersnatch . Black Mirror , along with American Horror Story and Inside No. 9 , has been credited with reviving the anthology television format and a number of episodes have been deemed prescient by the media. Episodes Main article: List of Black Mirror episodes The series was originally commissioned by Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and premiered in December 2011. A second series ran during February 2013. In September 2015, Netflix purchased the programme, commissioning a series of 12 episodes later divided into two series of six episodes. 1 The first six episodes were released simultaneously on Netflix worldwide as the overall third series on 21 October 2016. The fourth series of six episodes was released on 29 December 2017. 2 A fifth series consisting of three episodes was released on 5 June 2019. 3 The first four series, as well as the special White Christmas , have been released on DVD. 4 A sixth series was commissioned in 2022 and was released on 15 June 2023. 5 6 7 A seventh series was announced in November 2023, and was released on 10 April 2025. 8 9 Series Episodes Originally released First released Last released Network 1 3 4 December 2011 ( 2011-12-04 ) 18 December 2011 ( 2011-12-18 ) Channel 4 2 3 11 February 2013 ( 2013-02-11 ) 25 February 2013 ( 2013-02-25 ) Special 16 December 2014 ( 2014-12-16 ) 3 6 21 October 2016 ( 2016-10-21 ) Netflix 4 6 29 December 2017 ( 2017-12-29 ) Interactive film 28 December 2018 ( 2018-12-28 ) 5 3 5 June 2019 ( 2019-06-05 ) 6 5 15 June 2023 ( 2023-06-15 ) 7 6 10 April 2025 ( 2025-04-10 ) Premise Genre and themes As Black Mirror is an anthology series , each episode is standalone and can be watched in any order, although some episodes may contain references and easter eggs to previous episodes. 10 The programme is an instance of speculative fiction within science fiction: the majority of episodes are set in dystopian near-futures with novel technologies that exaggerate a trait from contemporary culture, often the internet. 11 12 13 An example is Crocodile , where the Recaller device used to view a person's memories is the main difference from the modern world. 11 Many such technologies involve altering the human body or consciousness , with little in-universe concern for the morality of these actions. 12 They provide convenience or freedom to the user, but exacerbate problematic personality traits. 12 13 Adrian Martin of Screen wrote that many episodes depict basic human emotions and desires that intersect with, and get twisted by, a technological system that invariably spins out of control and into catastrophe . 11 Retrofuturistic designs highlight the theme of each episode, often showing a lack of comfort, emotional connection or personalisation; 14 the settings are generally patriarchal and capitalist . 15 Recurring themes throughout Black Mirror include data privacy and surveillance , virtual reality , individualism and consumerism . 11 12 Many episodes have plot twists . 16 17 However, individual episodes explore varying genres. 11 Crime fiction episodes include the police procedurals Hated in the Nation and Smithereens and the Nordic noir Crocodile . 18 19 20 Horror and psychological horror are features of Black Museum and Playtest , respectively. 21 22 The first episode, The National Anthem , contains black comedy and political satire . 23 24 Some episodes employ features of lighter-hearted genres, such as romance in San Junipero and Striking Vipers , romantic comedy in Hang the DJ , or space opera in USS Callister . 25 26 27 28 Other genres include drama ( Fifteen Million Merits ), psychological thriller ( Black Mirror: Bandersnatch ), post-apocalyptic fiction ( Metalhead ), and war film ( Men Against Fire ). 11 15 29 30 Black Mirror can be seen to demonstrate a negative view of unending pursuit of scientific and technological advancement. 12 Juliana Lopes of Via Panorâmica argued that the dystopian settings resemble the French Marxist Guy Debord 's concept of the spectacle , wherein mass media create alienation and an unattainable utopia for individuals to pursue. For instance, in Nosedive , the protagonist Lacie strives for a utopian life through superficiality and performativity, in a society where social media success contributes to high socioeconomic status. 13 Academics writing in Quarterly Review of Film and Video found that Black Mirror episodes fall into a genre of mind-game films , wherein protagonists are disoriented and narratives are non-linear or fragmented. Films in this genre include Inception (2010) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), and these works often show the unreliability of the state, technology or family. 12 Some critics believed that episodes produced under Channel 4 had a more British tone or shared aesthetic qualities not found in later series. 11 12 In contrast, Netflix episodes including Nosedive , San Junipero , USS Callister and Hang the DJ evidence pastel aesthetics, use of 1980s or 1990s nostalgia and lighter-hearted tones than Channel 4 episodes. 12 The frequency of happy endings and positive uses of technology increase in later series. 31 32 33 With the use of a werewolf in Mazey Day and a demon in Demon 79 , the sixth series introduced supernatural horror elements to Black Mirror , and reduced the role of technology. 34 35 36 Connections between episodes Irma Thomas , whose 1964 song Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand) recurs throughout Black Mirror Later episodes include Easter egg allusions—small references to other instalments. For example, the fictional news channel UKN recurs between episodes, and the company Fence's Pizza appears in both USS Callister and Crocodile . 37 38 A large number of Easter eggs are found in news tickers and social media feeds shown in various episodes. 39 40 The main set of the final episode of the fourth series, Black Museum , included references to every prior episode of the series. 41 The song Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand) (1964) by Irma Thomas appears in seven episodes: Fifteen Million Merits , White Christmas , Men Against Fire , Crocodile , Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too , Joan Is Awful , and Common People . 42 43 A symbol designed by Brooker and first used in White Bear is a symbol of branching paths in Bandersnatch and marked on a talisman in Demon 79 , among other uses. 44 45 46 : 84 Actors rarely appear in more than one episode; those who do have unrelated roles. Aaron Paul starred in Beyond the Sea , a space-themed episode, after agreeing to a cameo in USS Callister if it did not bar him from appearing in other episodes. 47 48 Hannah John-Kamen played the singer Selma ( Fifteen Million Merits ) and the journalist Sonja ( Playtest ); Michaela Coel was an airline check-in worker ( Nosedive ) and the space crew member Shania ( USS Callister ); Monica Dolan acted as a police officer ( Smithereens ) and a protagonist's mother ( Loch Henry ); Daniel Lapaine played the minor character Max ( The Entire History of You ) and the doctor Daniel ( Black Museum ). Anjana Vasan and Paapa Essiedu from Demon 79 also make cameo appearances in USS Callister: Into Infinity . 49 50 51 52 53 A glyph recurring throughout the series, designed by Brooker and first used in White Bear 46 : 84 Some writers believe that Black Mirror episodes are set in a shared universe, due to the abundance of Easter eggs, or tonal and thematic connections across the programme as a whole. 12 Fans and journalists have attempted to establish concrete chronologies between episodes. 54 55 The series creator Charlie Brooker 's comments on this topic changed over time. He initially described the programme's setting as an artistic universe or psychologically shared universe . 40 54 After the release of the third series, he said that a line in Hated in the Nation that references the central crime in White Bear established a canonical connection between them. 39 Brooker said of Black Museum that it does actually now seem to imply that it is all a shared universe . 54 However, he described the Easter eggs in 2018 as an extra bit of texture for fans and not a consideration that limits the design of new episodes. 55 After the sixth series, Brooker commented that the viewer could consider each episode to be a Streamberry show—the Netflix parody featured in Joan Is Awful whose titles reference previous instalments. 44 Production Conception , ' > The black mirror of the title is the one you'll find on every wall, on every desk, in the palm of every hand: the cold, shiny screen of a TV, a monitor, a smartphone. Charlie Brooker , The Guardian 56 The series was created by Brooker, who was previously known as a comedy writer. 57 He wrote video game reviews for PC Zone in the late 1990s and began writing television reviews for The Guardian and working in television in the 2000s. 58 Brooker had completed production of Dead Set (2008), a zombie-based drama series, and while working on Newswipe (2009–2010) and other programmes, decided to make an anthology drama series. It was modelled in the style of The Twilight Zone (1959–1964), Tales of the Unexpected (1979–1988) and Hammer House of Horror (1980). 56 59 The title was inspired by the Arcade Fire song of the same name , with Booker using it to refer to the empty screen of an electronic device once it is turned off. 60 Brooker recognised that Rod Serling had based The Twilight Zone on contemporary issues, often controversial ones such as racism, but placed them in fictional settings to get around television censors at the time. Brooker realised he could comment similarly on modern issues, specifically focusing on technology, a topic he explored in producing the series How TV Ruined Your Life (2011). He aimed to explore the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time . 56 Brooker wanted to keep the anthology approach, using new stories, settings, characters, and actors for each episode, as he felt this was a key element of enjoying series like The Twilight Zone . This approach would allow Black Mirror to contrast with current dramas and serials that had a standard recurring cast. 56 According to Brooker, the production team considered giving the series a linking theme or presenter, but ultimately decided not to. 61 Writing process Charlie Brooker wrote the majority of episodes. Most episodes are credited solely to Brooker. Many originate with him talking to the executive producer Annabel Jones or others about a what-if idea , and considering if it could be the consequence of some new technology. 62 Brooker said that like his previous comedy writing, the premise is a worst case scenario compounded ; the ideas often make him laugh. 62 63 Episodes generally have only one aspect at a time that requires suspension of disbelief , and characters' actions are designed to feel authentic even if their predicaments are unusual. 57 Brooker avoided reacting to news events or topical subjects, as there was no guarantee of their continued relevance by the release date. 64 In the first two series, Brooker would plan less and write the script as he went along, which led to more dropped subplots and several iterations of rewriting White Bear in particular. 57 65 He would write with advertisement breaks in mind, as motivation to reach the next break, and so that he could insert some cliffhanger to make the audience return. 66 : 1:21:25 After the first two series, Brooker wrote a full outline preceding each first draft, finding that picturing an ending made the process easier even if the ending later changed. The outline could vary substantially in length, from two to twenty-five pages. 66 : 13:00 San Junipero was the first episode written for Netflix and came from a conscious decision to experiment with the tone of a Black Mirror episode. Following this, episodes became more tonally diverse. 64 Brooker would send a brief treatment to Netflix and receive feedback before beginning the first draft. 64 He wrote some material while standing up, as the slight discomfort discouraged time-wasting; he said that the first draft, the vomit draft , was always terrible, but had to be written. 67 He tried to picture the finished episode while writing and sometimes ran while listening to music as a source of inspiration. Brooker said that emotional speeches were easier to write, while sequences with many parts were harder. 68 Feedback that came from Jones and a director or cast member could have a large influence on the script. 64 Additionally, Brooker and Jones were involved in all aspects of production process, observing the filming and participating in the editing room where possible. 68 46 : 308 They pointed out logical inconsistencies and worked on the details of technological user interfaces . 69 Brooker said that the final edit could allow aspects that were not working to be fixed, or for introduction of overlooked ideas. 57 The episode The Entire History of You was written by Jesse Armstrong . 46 : 50 William Bridges is co-credited on both Shut Up and Dance and USS Callister and Brooker's wife Konnie Huq received a co-credit on Fifteen Million Merits . 46 : 31, 161, 225 For these episodes, Brooker did not write in the same room as his colleagues. One person would write the first draft and they would then iterate between feedback and re-writing. 66 : 1:13:30 On Nosedive , Michael Schur wrote the first half of the script and Rashida Jones wrote the second half, based on ideas and a story outline from Brooker. 70 Demon 79 was co-written by Brooker and Bisha K. Ali . 71 Series 1 Rory Kinnear starred as Prime Minister Michael Callow in the first episode, The National Anthem . The series's inception was in 2010. Brooker and Jones had begun to work together on Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe , a television review programme which aired from 2006 to 2008. The first pitch for Black Mirror , to the head of comedy at Channel 4, was for eight half-hour episodes by different authors. Technology was a lesser focus, and the worlds were larger and more detailed, which Jones said was not possible to execute properly in the short runtime. The series was then commissioned for three hour-long episodes. The first script was Fifteen Million Merits . 46 : 6–13 The second was Inbound , an episode that was never produced: it was a science fiction adaptation of what was revealed at the end to be a true story about a boy in the Iraq War . 66 : 1:01:00 Concepts from it were later repurposed for Men Against Fire . The following script pitched became The National Anthem , the first episode to air. The third episode is The Entire History of You . 46 : 6–13 The programme was produced by Brooker's production company Zeppotron, for the Dutch media company Endemol . Joel Collins served as production designer, with his company Painting Practice working on visual effects. In the early stages of Black Mirror , Jones was keen to avoid casting comedy actors, as Brooker was previously a comedy writer, and they wanted to distance the series from the genre. 46 : 16, 18 The production occurred concurrent to that of A Touch of Cloth , a satirical police procedural series that Brooker wrote for. 66 : 0:23:00 The series aired weekly from 4 December 2011. The National Anthem features Rory Kinnear as a British prime minister who must have sex with a pig for a kidnapped Princess to be released. In Fifteen Million Merits , Daniel Kaluuya plays Bing and Jessica Brown Findlay plays Abi, two characters in a society where most people must cycle each day to earn currency. The Entire History of You follows the married couple Liam and Ffion, played by Toby Kebbell and Jodie Whittaker , respectively, as Liam becomes suspicious of Ffion's relationship to a friend. 56 Series 2 Lenora Crichlow starred as Victoria Skillane in White Bear . The first series was expensive for Channel 4, as the anthology format meant there were no economies of scale , but Black Mirror was commissioned for a second series of three episodes. Brooker described it as dystopian hellscape , and relationship torn apart by technology , while the latter presents episodes of these forms in reverse. Each episode in the first series had a male protagonist, so Brooker deliberately wrote female protagonists for the first two episodes, Be Right Back and White Bear . 46 : 59–64 A trailer for the second series was made by Moving Picture Company and featured a dream sequence, a factory and a large dust cloud, but no extracts of series two episodes. 72 The series aired weekly from 11 February 2013. Be Right Back follows Martha ( Hayley Atwell ) turning to artificial intelligence for emotional support while grieving over the death of her partner Ash ( Domhnall Gleeson ). Lenora Crichlow stars as Victoria Skillane, a woman in a supposed apocalypse setting who has lost her memory, in White Bear . The Waldo Moment is a political satire starring Daniel Rigby as Jamie Salter, a man who contests a by-election as an animated bear. Black Mirror was first made available in the US from November 2013 via DirecTV , where episodes aired on Audience and were available online. 73 White Christmas According to Brooker, the series was still taking its budget from the comedy department of Channel 4, and there was discussion of whether it should fall under the drama department instead. Shane Allen, head of comedy for Channel 4 at the time, stated in 2018 that someone had been taken aback by the budget for Black Mirror , which was well above the standard for a comedy. The new head of comedy did not have an existing relationship with Brooker and Jones. 46 : 101–103 Jon Hamm , who played Matt in White Christmas Brooker reported in 2018 that Channel 4 agreed on a third series of four episodes, but requested detailed synopses of the episodes in advance. Brooker came up with an episode Angel of the Morning , which would later become a story in White Christmas . He also conceived of an episode based on the earlier script Inbound which would have been similar to the later Men Against Fire . Another episode was named Crocodile , which overlapped in parts with the series four episode of the same name. After a lengthy wait, Brooker and Jones were told that the ideas weren't very Black Mirror . Though Channel 4 may have suggested making a one-off special, Jones said that she felt a lack of clarity from them. 46 : 101–103 Jones and Brooker worked on other projects for the next year, such as A Touch of Cloth . 46 : 101–105 They set up House of Tomorrow, a division of Endemol under which later Black Mirror content would be produced. 74 After bumping into a Channel 4 staff member, Brooker emailed the channel to ask how to continue with Black Mirror . Channel 4 had the budget for an hour-long Christmas special, but Jones and Brooker pushed for a 90-minute episode. White Christmas was a portmanteau of three stories, inspired by works such as the 1983 science fiction film Twilight Zone: The Movie . It starred Jon Hamm as Matt and Rafe Spall as Joe throughout. Actors in the individual stories include: Rasmus Hardiker as Harry, Natalia Tena as Jennifer, Oona Chaplin as Greta, Janet Montgomery as Beth, and Ken Drury as Beth's father. The episode aired on 16 December 2014. 46 : 101–105 Move to Netflix On the day of the press screening for White Christmas , Brooker and Jones had a meeting with Channel 4 executives, who told them that they wanted to continue the series but due to budget constraints, it would need to be a co-production. The pair had travelled to Los Angeles a few months prior to try to secure co-production funding but were unsuccessful. The channel also suggested that Brooker could write an episode of Electric Dreams (2017–2018), an adaptation of short stories by Philip K. Dick . 46 : 123–124 They also considered a five-episode series with an overarching storyline, at the suggestion of a US network, nicknaming the plan Game of Drones . 58 On 1 December 2014, the first two series of the programme were released on Netflix in the United States after they bought exclusive streaming rights, leading to increased audience attention for the programme. 58 75 In a bidding war between channels, which included the American companies AMC , Syfy and HBO , Netflix led with a commitment of two series of ten episodes each. 58 46 : 125–126 Brooker and Jones reported in 2018 that although they and Netflix were both keen to have Channel 4 as equal partners, Channel 4 were evasive. They eventually got a meeting without discussion of a co-production with Netflix, where the channel suggested a renewal for three episodes. The channel later offered six episodes if full treatments could be given in advance, but Brooker and Jones were concerned due to past rejection of ideas. They had a limited time to reply to US offers and chose to make a deal with Netflix. 46 : 125–126 In September 2015, Netflix commissioned 12 episodes of Black Mirror . 76 By this point, the series was available in around 80 territories. 58 In March 2016, it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series in the UK, with a bid of US$40 million . 77 Endemol released a statement saying that Channel 4 had had the opportunity to recommission Black Mirror since 2013 and passed on this and subsequent co-production offers put to them. ... Further efforts were made to try to reach a settlement regarding a UK window for Channel 4, but these were also sadly to no avail . In a press release, Channel 4 stated that they offered to recommission Black Mirror . This marked the first time that an online streaming service had gained the rights to a series when the original network had wished to renew it. 78 Series 3 Gugu Mbatha-Raw (left) and Mackenzie Davis (right) starred in San Junipero , the first episode written for Netflix . In developing the third series's stories, Brooker had looked at previous episodes and recognised that all of the stories were about characters becoming trapped in a situation from which they could not escape. With the third series, Brooker wanted to explore different formats, adding more conventional stories like a romance and a police procedural. 79 The producer Lucy Dyke commented that Netflix expected the series to become bigger and better and more international , while production designer Joel Collins said that Netflix was happy to support ideas on the same scale or on a larger scale than previous episodes. The first episode that Brooker wrote for the series was San Junipero , and it was an intentional departure from previous episodes as well as a deliberate raspberry-blow at fans who were concerned at the series's potential Americanisation. 46 : 126–127 The titles of the six episodes that make up series three were announced in July 2016, along with the release date. 80 A trailer was released in October 2016. 81 The series was released on Netflix worldwide on 21 October 2016. 82 Nosedive is an episode starring Bryce Dallas Howard as Lacie, a woman pursuing social media popularity in a world where individuals assign ratings to every interaction with each other. Playtest is a horror story starring Wyatt Russell as Cooper, a playtester for a new virtual reality game. Shut Up and Dance is about a teenager blackmailed anonymously over the internet, starring Alex Lawther as Kenny and Jerome Flynn as Hector, and written by Brooker and William Bridges. San Junipero is a science fiction love story starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Kelly and Mackenzie Davis as Yorkie. Men Against Fire is a war story starring Malachi Kirby as Stripe. Hated in the Nation is a police procedural, with Kelly Macdonald as Karin Parke and Faye Marsay as Blue Coulson exploring the role of robot bees in a series of deaths. 46 : 129–219 Series 4 The magician Penn Jillette , who contributed to Black Museum Brooker said that the fourth series of six episodes has more variety than the third. 83 He began writing in July 2016 and continued throughout the 2016 United States presidential election ; he told Digital Spy that he did not know what demand there would be for nothing but bleak nihilism and thus included more hope than in previous series. 84 The first episode made was Arkangel , which was filmed in Canada in November 2016. 46 : 221 85 The Netflix budget allowed them to set and film Crocodile in Iceland and make the special effects-intensive episode Metalhead . 46 : 221 Filming concluded in June 2017. 86 In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror . 87 The first trailer debuted on 25 August 2017 and two promotional photos were released in September. 88 89 Beginning on 24 November, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for each episode in the fourth series of the programme, referred to as the 13 Days of Black Mirror , concluding on 6 December with the announcement of the release date, 29 December 2017. 90 91 USS Callister is a space epic based around a video game company, starring Jesse Plemons as CTO Robert Daly and Cristin Milioti as the new programmer Nanette Cole. Arkangel is an episode about a mother implanting an invasive technology in her daughter, starring Rosemarie DeWitt as Marie and Brenna Harding as Sara, and directed by Jodie Foster . Crocodile is about the consequences of a hit-and-run , starring Andrea Riseborough as Mia. Hang the DJ is a love story between Amy, played by Georgina Campbell , and Frank, played by Joe Cole , centred around an artificial intelligence that selects people's partners for them. Metalhead is a black-and-white apocalypse episode starring Maxine Peake as Bella, a woman trying to escape a robotic dog , and directed by David Slade . Black Museum is an anthology of three stories, one of which was written by the magician Penn Jillette . Focused around a crime museum, the episode stars Douglas Hodge as Rolo Haynes and Letitia Wright as Nish. 46 : 225–309 According to Engadget and Gizmodo , as a means of viral marketing Netflix sent private messages to users of the Turkish website Ekşi Sözlük . The messages were sent from the account iamwaldo and read, We know what you're up to. Watch and see what we will do. Although the advertising was met with positive reception from some users, others were concerned by distress that the messages may have caused. 92 93 Bandersnatch Main article: Black Mirror: Bandersnatch Fionn Whitehead , who starred as Stefan in Bandersnatch After much media speculation sparked by social media reports of filming, a quickly deleted Twitter announcement by Netflix and foreign film board certifications, Netflix announced on 27 December 2018 that the film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch would be released the following day. 94 95 96 97 Set in 1984, the film follows Stefan, portrayed by Fionn Whitehead , a young programmer who begins to question reality and experience deteriorating mental health as he adapts a sprawling fantasy novel into a video game. 98 99 Bandersnatch is an interactive film , regularly prompting the viewer to select one of two choices on screen that affect how the storyline continues; there are over one trillion potential paths to view the work and five distinct endings. Other main cast include Will Poulter , Craig Parkinson , Alice Lowe , and Asim Chaudhry . 100 Series 5 Miley Cyrus , who plays a pop star in the final episode of the fifth series, Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too Netflix announced the fifth series on 5 March 2018. 101 102 The complexity of Bandersnatch , which was originally part of the fifth series, delayed production, although Netflix still committed to its release in 2019. 103 104 The first episode, Striking Vipers , had been filmed prior to Bandersnatch . 105 On 15 May 2019, a trailer for the fifth series was released, indicating it would comprise three episodes. 3 On 5 June 2019, the series was released. Striking Vipers sees Danny ( Anthony Mackie ) and Karl ( Yahya Abdul-Mateen II ) exploring a virtual relationship despite Danny's marriage to Theo ( Nicole Beharie ). Smithereens follows Andrew Scott as Chris through his kidnapping of a social media company intern. Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too stars the two titular sisters ( Angourie Rice and Madison Davenport ) co-operating with a doll cloned from the pop star Ashley O ( Miley Cyrus ). 105 Series 6 Anjana Vasan stars as Nida in Demon 79 , the first episode written for the series. Around January 2020, Brooker and Jones announced their departure from House of Tomorrow. Variety reported that intellectual property issues were at the centre of this change, with the series's rights held by Endemol. 74 By February 2020, Brooker and Jones had established Broke and Bones, a new production company. 106 Netflix had arranged a long-term contract for series and other production rights with the Broke and Bones company by July 2020, although rights for Black Mirror still remained with Endemol. According to Variety , this left Brooker and Jones unable to produce additional series unless new agreements were put in place. 107 In a May 2020 interview with Radio Times , Brooker questioned whether the public mood would suit a sixth series of Black Mirror and said that he had been working on more comedic projects. 108 A sixth series was announced by Netflix in May 2022, to consist of more than three episodes. The series was produced by Broke and Bones, rather than House of Tomorrow. However, House of Tomorrow's new owners Banijay retained ownership of the programme. 109 Brooker started writing the sixth series with the idea to refresh or reset what Black Mirror was about. He stated that many new dystopian sci-fi programmes had emerged since its 2011 debut, and he now wished to focus on horror and settings in the past. 110 He said that Black Mirror should continually reinvent itself and display standalone stories; he began the series by deliberately upending his core assumptions about the programme. Some episodes contain elements he had previously sworn blind he would avoid. 5 6 The idea was to prevent Black Mirror being the show about consciousness being uploaded into a little disc .
