[ 2 ] A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to evoke human form , but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda 's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility ( ASIMO ) and TOSY 's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot ( TOPIO ) to industrial robots , medical operating robots , patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots , UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator , and even microscopic nanorobots . By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the future, with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers. [ 3 ] The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, [ 4 ] as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics . These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes , or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics . These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics . From the time of ancient civilization , there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automata , resembling humans and other animals, such as animatronics , designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age , there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote control and wireless remote-control . The term comes from a Slavic root, robot- , with meanings associated with labor. The word \"robot\" was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R. ( Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti – Rossum's Universal Robots ) by Karel Čapek , though it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England, in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen . The first commercial, digital and programmable robot was built by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate . It was sold to General Motors in 1961, where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey . [ 8 ] Robots have replaced humans [ 9 ] in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea. There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing number of functions. [ 10 ] The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future. .mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none} Summary iCub is physically anthropomorphic; it looks like a human. There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions: accept electronic programming, process data or physical perceptions electronically, operate autonomously to some degree, move around, operate physical parts of itself or physical processes, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behavior, especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents , but the latter are usually referred to as bots . [ 13 ] Related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology , which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to living things than to machines. Simpler automated machines are called automatons , like animatronics , often made to resemble humans or animals. Humanoid robots that resemble humans esthetically, possibly even organically, are called androids , while android can be shortened to droid , referring to robots with a broader likeness. On the other hand, a human that is augmented with artificial machines is called a cyborg , which is a particular type of transhuman . History Main article: History of robots A hypothetical reconstruction of Philo's automatic robot servant (3rd century BCE) in the Kotsanas Museum of Ancient Greek Technology , Athens, Greece Su Song 's astronomical clock tower showing the mechanical figurines which chimed the hours al-Jazari's musical toy, from the 13th century Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices Model of Leonardo's robot with inner workings. Possibly constructed by Leonardo da Vinci around 1495. [ 14 ] The Brennan torpedo , one of the earliest 'guided missiles' William H. Richards with \"George\", 1932 Early beginnings Many ancient cultures described artificial people in their writings. Examples from Greek mythology include Galatea (the mythical statue carved by Pygmalion that came to life), Talos (a man of bronze who guarded Crete from pirates), and the mechanical servants built by the Greek god Hephaestus . [ 15 ] Giants made of stone or clay are found in Jewish and Norse mythology. During classical antiquity , Greek engineers contributed many innovations. For example, in the 4th century BCE, Archytas described a steam-operated mechanical bird he called \"The Pigeon\", [ 16 ] while Ctesibius improved the clepsydra and produced the first hydraulus several decades later. [ 17 ] : 2 [ 18 ] Philo of Byzantium described a washstand automaton . Hero of Alexandria (10–70 AD) created numerous user-configurable automated devices and described machines powered by pneumatics , hydraulics , and steam, even including a \"speaking\" automaton. [ 19 ] Greek engineers also built the Antikythera mechanism — the oldest known example of an analog computer — during this period. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Ancient Chinese texts described automata, some of which were capable of flight. For example, the Han Feizi reports that 5th century BCE Mohist philosopher Mozi and his contemporary Lu Ban built artificial wooden birds that could fly. The Liezi (attributed to Lie Yukou , a 4th-century BCE Chinese philosopher) describes humanoid automata . [ 22 ] In 1066, Chinese inventor Su Song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] His mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments. The drummer could be programmed to play different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations. [ 25 ] 11th century texts of Buddhist mythology also describe automata. Examples include the Samarangana Sutradhara , a treatise by Bhoja (king of Malwa ) which includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical automata, including mechanical bees and birds, fountains shaped like humans and animals, and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps, danced, played instruments, and re-enacted scenes from Hindu mythology . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The Lokapannatti is an 11th-12th century Buddhist cosmological text that tells of how the Buddha's relics were protected by mechanical robots ( bhuta vahana yanta or \"spirit movement machines\") until they were disarmed by King Ashoka . [ 29 ] Ismail al-Jazari was a 13th-century polymath who built several automated devices driven by hydropower , including peacocks, [ 30 ] automatic gates, [ 31 ] and water clocks . [ 32 ] Among his humanoid automata was a waitress that could serve drinks. The drink was stored in a reservoir tank, from where it would drip into a bucket and then a cup, after which the waitress would appear out of an automatic door to serve the drink. [ 33 ] Al-Jazari also invented a hand washing automaton that incorporated a flush mechanism similar to that used in modern flush toilets. The automaton stood next to a basin filled with water. When the user pulled a lever, the water would drain and the automaton would refill the basin. [ 17 ] In 1377, the coronation of Richard II of England featured an automaton angel. [ 34 ] Around 1495, Leonardo da Vinci sketched plans for a mechanical humanoid robot that was able to sit up, wave its arms and move its head and jaw. [ 35 ] The design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his Vitruvian Man . Da Vinci may have been influenced by the automata of al-Jazari. [ 30 ] In Japan, complex automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries, with many described in the 1796 Karakuri zui ( Illustrated Machinery ). One such automaton was the karakuri ningyō . [ 36 ] Different variations of the karakuri existed: the butai karakuri , which were used in theatre, the zashiki karakuri , which were small and used in homes, and the dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals, where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends. In France, between 1738 and 1739, Jacques de Vaucanson exhibited several automatons: a flute player, a pipe player and a duck. The duck could flap its wings, crane its neck, swallow food from the exhibitor's hand, and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment. [ 37 ] About 30 years later in Switzerland, Pierre Jaquet-Droz made several mechanical figures that could write and play music. Several of these devices still exist and work. [ 38 ] Remote-controlled systems Remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes . The early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by John Ericsson , John Louis Lay , and Victor von Scheliha . [ 39 ] The Brennan torpedo , invented by Louis Brennan in 1877, was powered by two contra-rotating propellers that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo . Differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target, making it \"the world's first practical guided missile \". [ 40 ] In 1897 the British inventor Ernest Wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by \"Hertzian\" (radio) waves [ 41 ] [ 42 ] and in 1898 Nikola Tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless-controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the US Navy . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] In 1903, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo demonstrated a radio control system called Telekino at the Paris Academy of Sciences , [ 45 ] which he wanted to use to control an airship of his own design. He obtained several patents for the system in other countries. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Unlike previous 'on/off' techniques, Torres established a method for controlling any mechanical or electrical device with different states of operation. [ 48 ] The Telekino remotely controlled a tricycle in 1904, considered the first case of an unmanned ground vehicle , and an electric boat with a crew in 1906, which was controlled at a distance over 2 km. [ 49 ] Archibald Low , known as the \"father of radio guidance systems\" for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the First World War . In 1917, he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the Royal Flying Corps and in the same year built the first wire-guided rocket. Early robots In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots, Eric , was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Model Engineers Society in London, where it delivered a speech. Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot's frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve-volt power source. The robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control. [ 50 ] Both Eric and his \"brother\" George toured the world. [ 51 ] Westinghouse Electric Corporation built Televox in 1926; it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off. In 1939, the humanoid robot known as Elektro was debuted at the 1939 New York World's Fair . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Seven feet tall (2.1 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120.2 kg), it could walk by voice command, speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpm record player ), smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move its head and arms. The body consisted of a steel gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. In 1928, Japan's first robot, Gakutensoku , was designed and constructed by biologist Makoto Nishimura. The German V-1 flying bomb was equipped with systems for automatic guidance and range control, flying on a predetermined course (which could include a 90-degree turn) and entering a terminal dive after a predetermined distance. It was reported as being a 'robot' in contemporary descriptions. [ 54 ] Modern autonomous robots The first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol , England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie , were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis , by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power. Walter stressed the importance of using purely analogue electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation . His work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks , Hans Moravec and Mark Tilden . Modern incarnations of Walter's turtles may be found in the form of BEAM robotics . [ 55 ] The first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the Unimate . This ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry. [ 56 ] Devol sold the first Unimate to General Motors in 1960, and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in Trenton, New Jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them. [ 57 ] The first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company. [ 58 ] In 1973, a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] by KUKA robotics in Germany, and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by Victor Scheinman in 1976, and the design was sold to Unimation . Commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans. They are also employed for jobs which are too dirty, dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly and packing, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial goods.

One method is evolutionary robotics , in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent \"generation\" of robots. Another method is developmental robotics , which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem-solving and other functions. Another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named RoboHon. [ 63 ] As robots become more advanced, eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots. Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source software set of programs being developed at Stanford University , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and the Technical University of Munich , Germany, among others. ROS provides ways to program a robot's navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved. It also provides high-level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors. When ROS boots up on a robot's computer, it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots' limbs. It would relay this data to higher-level algorithms. Microsoft is also developing a \"Windows for robots\" system with its Robotics Developer Studio, which has been available since 2007. [ 64 ] Japan hopes to have full-scale commercialization of service robots by 2025. Much technological research in Japan is led by Japanese government agencies, particularly the Trade Ministry. [ 65 ] Many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people, even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] As early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would: [ 68 ] 1. Clean parts by removing molding flash 2. Spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3. Pack things in boxes—for example, orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4. Make electrical cable harness 5. Load trucks with boxes—a packing problem 6.

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( August 2021 ) In 2008, Caterpillar Inc. developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator. [ 69 ] Many analysts believe that self-driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics. [ 70 ] By 2014, Caterpillar had a self-driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining. In 2015, these Caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in Australia by the mining company Rio Tinto Coal Australia . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Some analysts believe that within the next few decades, most trucks will be self-driving. [ 75 ] A literate or 'reading robot' named Marge has intelligence that comes from software. She can read newspapers, find and correct misspelled words, learn about banks like Barclays, and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others. [ 76 ] Baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance. A worker could teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular worker could program Baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding to be used. This means Baxter needs no programming to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter can be taught to perform multiple, more complicated tasks. Sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller, more precise tasks. [ 77 ] Prototype cooking robots have been developed and could be programmed for autonomous, dynamic and adjustable preparation of discrete meals. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Etymology See also: Glossary of robotics A scene from Karel Čapek 's 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) , showing three robots The word robot was introduced to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) , published in 1920. [ 6 ] The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people called robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids , creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans). Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother, the painter and writer Josef Čapek , as its actual originator. [ 6 ] In an article in the Czech journal Lidové noviny in 1933, he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři ( ' workers ' , from Latin labor ). However, he did not like the word, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested roboti . The word robota means literally ' corvée , serf labor ' , and figuratively ' drudgery, hard work ' in Czech and also (more general) ' work, labor ' in many Slavic languages (e.g.: Bulgarian , Russian , Serbian , Croatian , Slovenian , Slovak , Polish , Macedonian , Ukrainian and archaic Czech) as well as robot in Hungarian . Traditionally the robota (Hungarian robot ) was the work period a serf (corvée) had to give for his lord, typically six months of the year. The origin of the word is the Old Church Slavonic rabota ' servitude ' ( ' work ' in contemporary Bulgarian, Macedonian and Russian), which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European root * orbh- . Robot is cognate with the German Arbeit ' work ' . [ 80 ] [ 81 ] English pronunciation of the word has evolved relatively quickly since its introduction. In the U.S. during the late 1930s to early 1940s it was pronounced / ˈ r oʊ b oʊ t / . [ 82 ] [ better source needed ] By the late 1950s to early 1960s, some were pronouncing it / ˈ r oʊ b ə t / , while others used / ˈ r oʊ b ɒ t / [ 83 ] By the 1970s, its current pronunciation / ˈ r oʊ b ɒ t / had become predominant. The word robotics , used to describe this field of study, [ 4 ] was coined by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov . Asimov created the Three Laws of Robotics which are a recurring theme in his books. These have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction. (The three laws are pure fiction, and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them, and in fact most robots serve military purposes, which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law. \"People think about Asimov's laws, but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn't work. If you read the short stories, every single one is about a failure, and they are totally impractical,\" said Dr. Joanna Bryson of the University of Bath. [ 84 ] ) Modern robots Mobile robot Main articles: Mobile robot and Automated guided vehicle Mobile robots [ 85 ] have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location. An example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle (AGV). An AGV is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision or lasers. [ 86 ] AGVs are discussed later in this article. Mobile robots are also found in industry, military and security environments. [ 87 ] They also appear as consumer products, for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning. Mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research. [ 88 ] Mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference. Because of this most humans rarely encounter robots. However domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries. Robots can also be found in military applications. [ 89 ] Industrial robots (manipulating) Main articles: Industrial robot and Manipulator (device) Industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm (multi-linked manipulator) and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface. One of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly. The International Organization for Standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in ISO 8373 : \"an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose, manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications.\" [ 90 ] This definition is used by the International Federation of Robotics , the European Robotics Research Network (EURON) and many national standards committees. [ 91 ] The industrial robots in food and drink processing plants are used for tasks such as feeding machines, packaging, and palletizing, which have replaced many manual, physical tasks. The complexity of digital skills required by workers varies depending on the level of automation and the specific tasks involved. [ 92 ] Service robot Main article: Service robot Most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods. The term \"service robot\" is less well-defined. The International Federation of Robotics has proposed a tentative definition, \"A service robot is a robot which operates semi- or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well-being of humans and equipment, excluding manufacturing operations.\" [ 93 ] Educational (interactive) robots Main article: Educational robotics Robots are used as educational assistants to teachers. From the 1980s, robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the Logo language. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] There are robot kits like Lego Mindstorms , BIOLOID , OLLO from ROBOTIS, or BotBrain Educational Robots can help children to learn about mathematics, physics, programming, and electronics. Robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). The organization is the foundation for the FIRST Robotics Competition , FIRST Tech Challenge , FIRST Lego League Challenge and FIRST Lego League Explore competitions. There have also been robots such as the teaching computer, Leachim (1974). [ 96 ] Leachim was an early example of speech synthesis using the Diphone synthesis method. 2-XL (1976) was a robot shaped game / teaching toy based on branching between audible tracks on an 8-track tape player, both invented by Michael J. Freeman . [ 97 ] Later, the 8-track was upgraded to tape cassettes and then to digital. Modular robot Main article: Self-reconfiguring modular robot Modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the use of robots by modularizing their architecture. [ 98 ] The functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots. These robots are composed of a single type of identical, several different identical module types, or similarly shaped modules, which vary in size. Their architectural structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots, as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom (DOF). Creating the programming, inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots. Modular robots may be composed of L-shaped modules, cubic modules, and U and H-shaped modules. ANAT technology, an early modular robotic technology patented by Robotics Design Inc., allows the creation of modular robots from U- and H-shaped modules that connect in a chain, and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems. These \"ANAT robots\" can be designed with \"n\" DOF as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain, and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom. The more modules that are connected to one another, the more degrees of freedom it will have. L-shaped modules can also be designed in a chain, and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases, as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base. ANAT H-shaped modules do not suffer from this problem, as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules, and therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases. Modular robots can be manually or self-reconfigured to form a different robot, that may perform different applications. Because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots, a snake-arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra-arm robot, or can split into several mobile robots, and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones, or combine with others into a larger or different one. This allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task, as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks. Modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation, [ 99 ] industrial automation, [ 100 ] duct cleaning [ 101 ] and handling. Many research centres and universities have also studied this technology, and have developed prototypes. Collaborative robots A collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks. However, end-effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards, and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion-control application. [ 102 ] The collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by Universal Robots in Denmark. [ 103 ] Rethink Robotics —founded by Rodney Brooks , previously with iRobot —introduced Baxter in September 2012; as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers, and be programmable for performing simple tasks. [ 104 ] Baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches. Intended for sale to small businesses, they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer. [ 105 ] As of May 2014 [ update ] , 190 companies in the US have bought Baxters and they are being used commercially in the UK. [ 10 ] Robots in society TOPIO , a humanoid robot , played ping pong at Tokyo International Robot Exhibition (IREX) 2009. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Roughly half of all the robots in the world are in Asia, 32% in Europe, and 16% in North America, 1% in Australasia and 1% in Africa. [ 108 ] 40% of all the robots in the world are in Japan, [ 109 ] making Japan the country with the highest number of robots. Autonomy and ethical questions Main articles: Roboethics and Ethics of artificial intelligence An android , or robot designed to resemble a human, can appear comforting to some people and disturbing to others. [ 110 ] As robots have become more advanced and sophisticated, experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots' behavior, [ 111 ] [ 112 ] and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social, cultural, ethical or legal rights. [ 113 ] One scientific team has said that it was possible that a robot brain would exist by 2019. [ 114 ] Others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050. [ 115 ] Recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated. [ 116 ] The social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called Plug &amp; Pray . [ 117 ] Vernor Vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans. He calls this \" the Singularity \". [ 118 ] He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans. [ 119 ] This is discussed by a philosophy called Singularitarianism . In 2009, experts attended a conference hosted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy, and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \"cockroach intelligence.\" They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls. [ 118 ] Various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy, and which pose some inherent concerns. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] Military robots Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions. [ 123 ] There are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots. [ 124 ] The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that, as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] One researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane, as they could make decisions more effectively. However, other experts question this. [ 127 ] One robot in particular, the EATR , has generated public concerns [ 128 ] over its fuel source, as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances. [ 129 ] Although the engine for the EATR is designed to run on biomass and vegetation [ 130 ] specifically selected by its sensors, which it can find on battlefields or other local environments, the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used. [ 131 ] Manuel De Landa has noted that \"smart missiles\" and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots, as they make some of their decisions autonomously. He believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines. [ 132 ] Relationship to unemployment Main article: Technological unemployment For centuries, people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment , although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy. [ 133 ] [ 134 ] [ 135 ] A recent example of human replacement involves Taiwanese technology company Foxconn who, in July 2011, announced a three-year plan to replace workers with more robots. At present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three-year period. [ 136 ] Lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws. [ 137 ] Kevin J. Delaney said \"Robots are taking human jobs. But Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies' use of them, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment.\" [ 138 ] The robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers. The World Bank 's World Development Report 2019 puts forth evidence showing that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance. [ 139 ] Contemporary uses See also: List of robots At present, there are two main types of robots, based on their use: general-purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots. Robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose. A robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well, or a range of tasks less well. All robots by their nature can be re-programmed to behave differently, but some are limited by their physical form. For example, a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting, welding, gluing, or acting as a fairground ride, while a pick-and-place robot can only populate printed circuit boards. General-purpose autonomous robots Main article: Autonomous robot General-purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently. General-purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces, handle their own re-charging needs, interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks. Like computers, general-purpose robots can link with networks, software and accessories that increase their usefulness. They may recognize people or objects, talk, provide companionship, monitor environmental quality, respond to alarms, pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks. General-purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day. Some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance; this type of robot is called a humanoid robot. Humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage, as no humanoid robot can, as of yet, actually navigate around a room that it has never been in",
