Supply chain management field of operations: complex and dynamic supply and demand networks [ 1 ] (cf. Wieland/Wallenburg, 2011) In an efficient supply chain, agreements are aligned. In commerce , supply chain management ( SCM ) deals with a system of procurement (purchasing raw materials/components), operations management , logistics and marketing channels , through which raw materials can be developed into finished products and delivered to their end customers . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] A more narrow definition of supply chain management is the \"design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronising supply with demand and measuring performance globally\". [ 4 ] [ 5 ] This can include the movement and storage of raw materials , work-in-process inventory , finished goods, and end to end order fulfilment from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Interconnected, interrelated or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain . [ 6 ] SCM is the broad range of activities required to plan, control and execute a product's flow from materials to production to distribution in the most economical way possible. SCM encompasses the integrated planning and execution of processes required to optimize the flow of materials, information and capital in functions that broadly include demand planning, sourcing, production, inventory management and logisticsâor storage and transportation. [ 7 ] Supply chain management strives for an integrated, multidisciplinary, multimethod approach. [ 8 ] Current [ when? ] research in supply chain management is concerned with topics related to resilience , sustainability , and risk management , [ 9 ] among others. Some suggest that the \"people dimension\" of SCM, ethical issues, internal integration, transparency/visibility, and human capital/talent management are topics that have, so far, been underrepresented on the research agenda. [ 10 ] Intention Supply chain management, techniques with the aim of coordinating all parts of SC, from supplying raw materials to delivering and/or resumption of products, tries to minimize total costs with respect to existing conflicts among the chain partners. An example of these conflicts is the interrelation between the sale department desiring to have higher inventory levels to fulfill demands and the warehouse for which lower inventories are desired to reduce holding costs . [ 11 ] Origin of the term and definitions In 1982, Keith Oliver , a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton , introduced the term \"supply chain management\" to the public domain in an interview for the Financial Times . [ 12 ] In 1983 WirtschaftsWoche in Germany published for the first time the results of an implemented and so called \"Supply Chain Management project\", led by Wolfgang Partsch . [ 13 ] In the mid-1990s, the term \"supply chain management\" gained popularity when a flurry of articles and books came out on the subject. Supply chains were originally defined as encompassing all activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw materials through to the end user or final consumer , as well as the associated information flows. Mentzer et al. consider it worthy of note that the final consumer was included within these early definitions. [ 14 ] : 2 Supply chain management was then further defined as the integration of supply chain activities through improved supply chain relationships to achieve a competitive advantage. [ 12 ] In the late 1990s, \"supply chain management\" (SCM) rose to prominence, and operations managers began to use it in their titles with increasing regularity. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] A supply chain, as opposed to supply chain management, is a set of firms who move materials \"forward\", [ 18 ] or a set of organizations, directly linked by one or more upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, or information from a source to a customer. Supply chain management is the management of such a chain. [ 14 ] Other commonly accepted definitions of supply chain management include: The management of upstream and downstream value-added flows of materials, final goods, and related information among suppliers, company, resellers , and final consumers. [ 19 ] The systematic, strategic coordination of traditional business functions and tactics across all business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of improving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole. [ 14 ] A customer-focused definition is given by Hines (2004:p76): \"Supply chain strategies require a total systems view of the links in the chain that work together efficiently to create customer satisfaction at the end point of delivery to the consumer. As a consequence, costs must be lowered throughout the chain by driving out unnecessary expenses, movements, and handling. The main focus is turned to efficiency and added value, or the end user's perception of value. Efficiency must be increased, and bottlenecks removed. The measurement of performance focuses on total system efficiency and the equitable monetary reward distribution to those within the supply chain. The supply chain system must be responsive to customer requirements.\" [ 20 ] The integration of key business processes across the supply chain for the purpose of creating value for customers and stakeholders. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] According to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP), supply chain management encompasses the planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing , procurement, conversion, and logistics management . It also includes coordination and collaboration with channel partners , which may be suppliers , intermediaries , third-party service providers, or customers . [ 23 ] Supply chain management integrates supply and demand management within and across companies. More recently, the loosely coupled, self-organizing network of businesses that cooperate to provide product and service offerings has been called the Extended Enterprise . [ citation needed ] Mentzer et al. make a further distinction between \"supply chain management\" and a \"supply chain orientation\". The latter term involves a recognition that a business strategy cannot be fulfilled without managing the activities of suppliers and customers upstream and downstream, whereas the former term is used for \"the actual implementation of this orientation\". [ 14 ] Supply chain visibility , in its origins, was concerned with knowledge of the location, production stage and expected delivery date of incoming products and materials, so that production could be planned, [ 24 ] but the development of the term has enabled it to be used to plan orders using knowledge of potential supplies, and to track post-production processes as far as delivery to customers. [ 25 ] The UK Government also uses the term \"supply chain visibility\" in conjunction with its mandate to ensure that potential suppliers have visibility into future supply opportunities. The government's action note on supply chain visibility covers obligations and appropriate contractual wording requiring prime suppliers to advertise sub-contracting opportunities and to report on their spend with small and medium-sized enterprises and voluntary/community organisations within their supply chains. [ 26 ] The concept of a \"supply chain control tower\" reflects the \"end-to-end visibility\" provided by an air traffic control tower. [ 27 ] Writing for Gartner , sees a \"supply chain control tower\" as a concept which combines the capacities of \"people, process, data, organization and technology\" to improve supply chain visibility, noting that the technology behind a system which draws together information from a number of sources should not be separated from the people and processes it supports in order to improve visibility. [ 28 ] Supply chain management software includes tools or modules used to execute supply chain transactions, manage supplier relationships, and control associated business processes. [ 29 ] The overall goal of the software is to improve supply chain performance by monitoring a company's supply chain network from end-to-end (suppliers, transporters, returns, warehouses, retailers, manufacturers, and customers). [ 29 ] In some cases, a supply chain includes the collection of goods after consumer use for recycling or the reverse logistics processes for returning faulty or unwanted products back to producers up the value chain. [ 30 ] Functions Supply chain management is a cross-functional approach that includes managing the movement of raw materials into an organization, certain aspects of the internal processing of materials into finished goods, and the movement of finished goods out of the organization and toward the end consumer. As organizations strive to focus on core competencies and become more flexible, they reduce ownership of raw materials sources and distribution channels. These functions are increasingly being outsourced to other firms that can perform the activities better or more cost effectively. The effect is to increase the number of organizations involved in satisfying customer demand, while reducing managerial control of daily logistics operations. Less control and more supply chain partners lead to the creation of the concept of supply chain management. [ 31 ] Supply chain management is concerned with improving trust and collaboration among supply chain partners, thus improving inventory visibility and the velocity of inventory movement. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Importance Organizations increasingly find that they must rely on effective supply chains, or networks, to compete in the global market and networked economy. [ 34 ] In Peter Drucker 's (1998) new management paradigms, this concept of business relationships extends beyond traditional enterprise boundaries and seeks to organize entire business processes throughout a value chain of multiple companies. According to Drucker, \"the greatest change in corporate cultureâand the way business is being conductedâmay be the accelerated growth of relationships based not on ownership, but on partnership.\" [ 35 ] This approach allows companies to leverage the strengths and capabilities of various partners to achieve greater efficiency and innovation, ultimately enhancing overall business performance. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] In recent decades, globalization, outsourcing, and information technology have enabled many organizations, such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard , to successfully operate collaborative supply networks in which each specialized business partner focuses on only a few key strategic activities. [ 37 ] This inter-organizational supply network can be acknowledged as a new form of organization. However, with the complicated interactions among the players, the network structure fits neither \"market\" nor \"hierarchy\" categories. [ 38 ] It is not clear what kind of performance impacts different supply-network structures could have on firms, and little is known about the coordination conditions and trade-offs that may exist among the players. From a systems perspective, a complex network structure can be decomposed into individual component firms. [ 39 ] Traditionally, companies in a supply network concentrate on the inputs and outputs of the processes, with little concern for the internal management working of other individual players. Therefore, the choice of an internal management control structure is known to impact local firm performance. [ 40 ] In the 21st century, changes in the business environment have contributed to the development of supply chain networks. First, as an outcome of globalization and the proliferation of multinational companies, joint ventures, strategic alliances , and business partnerships, significant success factors were identified, complementing the earlier \" just-in-time \", lean manufacturing , and agile manufacturing practices. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Second, technological changes, particularly the dramatic fall in communication costs (a significant component of transaction costs), have led to changes in coordination among the members of the supply chain network. [ 45 ] Many researchers have recognized supply network structures as a new organizational form, using terms such as \" Keiretsu \", \"Extended Enterprise\", \"virtual supply chain\", [ 46 ] \" Global Production Network \", and \"Next Generation Manufacturing System\". [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] In general, such a structure can be defined as \"a group of semi-independent organizations, each with their capabilities, which collaborate in ever-changing constellations to serve one or more markets in order to achieve some business goal specific to that collaboration\". [ 50 ] The importance of supply chain management proved crucial in the 2019-2020 fight against the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that swept across the world. [ 51 ] During the pandemic period, governments in countries which had in place effective domestic supply chain management had enough medical supplies to support their needs and enough to donate their surplus to front-line health workers in other jurisdictions. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] The devastating COVID-19 crisis in US has turned many sectors of the local economy upside down, including the country's storied logistics industry. Some organizations were able to quickly develop foreign supply chains in order to import much needed medical supplies. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Supply chain management is also important for organizational learning. Firms with geographically more extensive supply chains connecting diverse trading cliques tend to become more innovative and productive. [ 58 ] The security-management system for supply chains is described in ISO/IEC 28000 and ISO/IEC 28001 and related standards published jointly by the ISO and the IEC . Supply Chain Management draws heavily from the areas of operations management, logistics, procurement, and information technology, and strives for an integrated approach. Supply chain resilience An important element of SCM is supply chain resilience , defined as \"the capacity of a supply chain to persist, adapt, or transform in the face of change\". [ 59 ] For a long time, the interpretation of resilience in the sense of engineering resilience (= robustness [ 60 ] ) prevailed in supply chain management, leading to the notion of persistence . [ 59 ] A popular implementation of this idea is given by measuring the time-to-survive and the time-to-recover of the supply chain, allowing to identify weak points in the system. [ 61 ] The APICS Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP) program emphasizes the importance of managing risks and enhancing resilience. According to APICS, in order to manage global interruptions and preserve operational continuity, a robust supply chain is vital. [ 36 ] More recently, the interpretations of resilience in the sense of ecological resilience and socialâecological resilience have led to the notions of adaptation and transformation , respectively. [ 59 ] A supply chain is thus interpreted as a social-ecological system that â similar to an ecosystem (e.g. forest) â is able to constantly adapt to external environmental conditions and â through the presence of social actors and their ability to foresight â also to transform itself into a fundamentally new system. [ 62 ] This leads to a panarchical interpretation of a supply chain, embedding it into a system of systems , allowing to analyze the interactions of the supply chain with systems that operate at other levels (e.g. society, political economy, planet Earth). [ 62 ] For example, these three components of resilience can be discussed for the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction , when a ship blocked the canal for several days. Persistence means to \"bounce back\"; in our example it is about removing the ship as quickly as possible to allow \"normal\" operations. Adaptation means to accept that the system has reached a \"new normal\" state and to act accordingly; here, this can be implemented by redirecting ships around the African cape or use alternative modes of transport. Finally, transformation means to question the assumptions of globalization, outsourcing and linear supply chains and to envision alternatives; in this example this could lead to local and circular supply chains that do not need global transportation routes any longer. Historical developments Six major movements can be observed in the evolution of supply chain management studies: creation, integration, globalization , [ 63 ] specialization phases one and two, and SCM 2.0. Creation era The term \"supply chain management\" was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982. However, the concept of a supply chain in management was of great importance long before, in the early 20th century, especially with the creation of the assembly line . The characteristics of this era of supply chain management include the need for large-scale changes, re-engineering, downsizing driven by cost reduction programs, and widespread attention to Japanese management practices. However, the term became widely adopted after the publication of the seminal book Introduction to Supply Chain Management in 1999 by Robert B. Handfield and Ernest L. Nichols, Jr., [ 64 ] which published over 25,000 copies and was translated into Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian. [ 65 ] Integration era This era of supply chain management studies was highlighted with the development of electronic data interchange (EDI) systems in the 1960s and developed through the 1990s by the introduction of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This era has continued to develop into the 21st century with the expansion of Internet-based collaborative systems. This era of supply chain evolution is characterized by both increasing value-added and reducing costs through integration. [ citation needed ] A supply chain can be classified as a stage 1, 2, or 3 network. In stage 1âtype supply chain, systems such as production, storage, distribution, and material control are not linked and are independent of each other. In a stage 2 supply chain, these are integrated under one plan, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) is enabled. A stage 3 supply chain is one that achieves vertical integration with upstream suppliers and downstream customers. An example of this kind of supply chain is Tesco . [ citation needed ] Globalization era It is the third movement of supply chain management development, the globalization era, can be characterized by the attention given to global systems of supplier relationships and the expansion of supply chains beyond national boundaries and into other continents. Although the use of global sources in organizations' supply chains can be traced back several decades (e.g., in the oil industry), it was not until the late 1980s that a considerable number of organizations started to integrate global sources into their core business. [ citation needed ] This era is characterized by the globalization of supply chain management in organizations with the goal of increasing their competitive advantage, adding value, and reducing costs through global sourcing. [ citation needed ] Specialization era (phase I): outsourced manufacturing and distribution In the 1990s, companies began to focus on \"core competencies\" and specialization. They abandoned vertical integration, sold off non-core operations, and outsourced those functions to other companies. This changed management requirements, as the supply chain extended beyond the company walls and management was distributed across specialized supply chain partnerships. [ citation needed ] This transition also refocused the fundamental perspectives of each organization. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) became brand owners that required visibility deep into their supply base. They had to control the entire supply chain from above, instead of from within. Contract manufacturers had to manage bills of material with different part-numbering schemes from multiple OEMs and support customer requests for work-in-process visibility and vendor-managed inventory (VMI). [ citation needed ] The specialization model creates manufacturing and distribution networks composed of several individual supply chains specific to producers, suppliers, and customers that work together to design, manufacture, distribute, market, sell, and service a product. This set of partners may change according to a given market, region, or channel, resulting in a proliferation of trading partner environments, each with its own unique characteristics and demands. [ citation needed ] Specialization era (phase II): supply chain management as a service Specialization within the supply chain began in the 1980s with the inception of transportation brokerages, warehouse management (storage and inventory), and non-asset-based carriers, and has matured beyond transportation and logistics into aspects of supply planning, collaboration, execution, and performance management. Market forces sometimes demand rapid changes from suppliers, logistics providers, locations, or customers in their role as components of supply chain networks. This variability has significant effects on supply chain infrastructure, from the foundation layers of establishing and managing electronic communication between trading partners to more complex requirements such as the configuration of processes and workflows that are essential to the management of the network itself. Supply chain specialization enables companies to improve their overall competencies in the same way that outsourced manufacturing and distribution has done; it allows them to focus on their core competencies and assemble networks of specific, best-in-class partners to contribute to the overall value chain itself, thereby increasing overall performance and efficiency. The ability to quickly obtain and deploy this domain-specific supply chain expertise without developing and maintaining an entirely unique and complex competency in house is a leading reason why supply chain specialization is gaining popularity. Outsourced technology hosting for supply chain solutions debuted in the late 1990s and has taken root primarily in transportation and collaboration categories. This has progressed from the application service provider (ASP) model from roughly 1998 through 2003 to the on-demand model from approximately 2003 through 2006, to the software as a service (SaaS) model currently in focus today.

( February 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The term SCM 2.0 has been coined to describe both changes within supply chains themselves as well as the evolution of processes, methods, and tools to manage them in a new era of globalization and specialization. One element of this is the growing popularity of supply chain collaboration platforms that connect multiple buyers and suppliers with financial institutions, enabling them to conduct automated supply chain finance transactions. [ 66 ] Web 2.0 is a trend in the use of the World Wide Web that is meant to increase creativity, information sharing, and collaboration among users. At its core, the common attribute of Web 2.0 is to help navigate the vast information available on the Web in order to find what is being bought. It is the notion of a usable pathway. SCM 2.0 replicates this notion in supply chain operations. It is the pathway to SCM results, a combination of processes, methodologies, tools, and delivery options to guide companies to their results quickly as the complexity and speed of the supply chain increase due to global competition; rapid price fluctuations; changing oil prices; short product life cycles; expanded specialization; near-, far-, and off-shoring; and talent scarcity. Increasing volatility has characterized supply chains since about 2000. Douglass in 2010 referred to an SCM management style known as \"extreme supply chain management\", which: Hochfelder, B., [https://www.sdcexec.com/home/article/10326695/extreme-supply-chain-management Executive Memo: Supply chain volatility], &apos;&apos;Supply &amp; Demand Chain Executive&apos;&apos;, published 17 August 2011, accessed 10 March 2023&lt;/ref>\"}},\"i\":0}}]}' id=\"mwAeY\">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;margin-top:0}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{padding-left:1.6em}} recognizes the need for collective, rather than sequential, risk management and facilitates collaboration on a new scale that is necessary for survival.

( June 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Successful SCM requires a change from managing individual functions to integrating activities into key supply chain processes. In an example scenario, a purchasing department places orders as its requirements become known. The marketing department, responding to customer demand, communicates with several distributors and retailers as it attempts to determine ways to satisfy this demand. Information shared between supply chain partners can only be fully leveraged through business process integration , e.g., using electronic data interchange . Supply chain business process integration involves collaborative work between buyers and suppliers, joint product development, common systems, and shared information. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), operating an integrated supply chain requires a continuous information flow. However, in many companies, management has concluded that optimizing product flows cannot be accomplished without implementing a process approach. The key supply chain processes as stated by Lambert (2004) [ 68 ] are: Customer relationship management Customer service management Demand management Order fulfillment Manufacturing flow management Supplier relationship management Product development and commercialization Returns management Much has been written about demand management . [ 69 ] Best-in-class companies have similar characteristics, which include the following: Internal and external collaboration Initiatives to reduce lead time Tighter feedback from customer and market demand Customer-level forecasting One could suggest other critical supply business processes that combine these processes stated by Lambert, such as: Customer service management process Customer relationship management concerns the relationship between an organization and its customers. Customer service is the source of customer information. It also provides the customer with real-time information on scheduling and product availability through interfaces with the company's production and distribution operations. Successful organizations use the following steps to build customer relationships: determine mutually satisfying goals for organization and customers establish and maintain customer rapport induce positive feelings in the organization and the customers Business strategy integration Effective business process integration in supply chain management requires not only continuous communication, but also strategic coordination across departments and partner companies. The main reason for this is that it can effectively improve agility. [ 70 ] At the same time, this integration can help businesses respond quickly to changes in demand and improve customer satisfaction. Inventory management Inventory management is concerned with ensuring the right stock at the right levels, in the right place, at the right time and the right cost. Inventory management entails inventory planning and forecasting: forecasting helps planning inventory. Procurement process Strategic plans are drawn up with suppliers to support the manufacturing flow management process and the development of new products. [ 71 ] In firms whose operations extend globally, sourcing may be managed on a global basis. The desired outcome is a relationship where both parties benefit and a reduction in the time required for the product's design and development. The purchasing function may also develop rapid communication systems, such as electronic data interchange (EDI) and internet linkage, to convey possible requirements more rapidly. Activities related to obtaining products and materials from outside suppliers involve resource planning, supply sourcing, negotiation, order placement, inbound transportation, storage, handling, and quality assurance , many of which include the responsibility to coordinate with suppliers on matters of scheduling, supply continuity (inventory), hedging, and research into new sources or programs. Procurement has recently been recognized as a core source of value, driven largely by the increasing trends to outsource products and services, and the changes in the global ecosystem requiring stronger relationships between buyers and sellers. [ 72 ] Product development and commercialization Here, customers and suppliers must be integrated into the product development process in order to reduce the time to market. As product life cycles shorten, the appropriate products must be developed and successfully launched with ever-shorter time schedules in order for firms to remain competitive. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), managers of the product development and commercialization process must: coordinate with customer relationship management to identify customer-articulated needs; select materials and suppliers in conjunction with procurement; and develop production technology in manufacturing flow to manufacture and integrate into the best supply chain flow for the given combination of product and markets. Integration of suppliers into the new product development process was shown to have a major impact on product target cost, quality, delivery, and market share. Tapping into suppliers as a source of innovation requires an extensive process characterized by development of technology sharing, but also involves managing intellectual [ 73 ] property issues. Manufacturing flow management process The manufacturing process produces and supplies products to the distribution channels based on past forecasts. Manufacturing processes must be flexible in order to respond to market changes and must accommodate mass customization . Orders are processes operating on a just-in-time (JIT) basis in minimum lot sizes. Changes in the manufacturing flow process lead to shorter cycle times (cycle time compression), meaning improved responsiveness and efficiency in meeting customer demand. La Londe and Masters found in 1994 research that improved supply chain management and cycle time compression were complementary strategies adopted by forward-looking businesses in the United States. [ 18 ] This process manages activities related to planning, scheduling, and supporting manufacturing operations, such as work-in-process storage, handling, transportation, and time phasing of components, inventory at manufacturing sites, and maximum flexibility in the coordination of geographical and final assemblies postponement of physical distribution operations. Physical distribution This concerns the movement of a finished product or service to customers. In physical distribution, the customer is the final destination of a marketing channel, and the availability of the product or service is a vital part of each channel participant's marketing effort. It is also through the physical distribution process that the time and space of customer service become an integral part of marketing. Thus it links a marketing channel with its customers (i.e., it links manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers). Fleet management Fleet management is the function within supply chain management that is responsible for overseeing a company's fleet of vehicles. This includes not only trucks and vans but also other assets like ships, planes, and specialized machinery. The primary goals are to ensure the efficient and safe operation of these assets, manage maintenance schedules, and control costs, particularly fuel consumption . [ 74 ] Modern fleet management is a key component of fleet digitalization . It relies heavily on telematics and vehicle tracking systems to provide real-time data on vehicle location, driver behavior, and engine diagnostics. This telemetry data is used to optimize routes, schedule predictive maintenance, and enhance the overall visibility and control of the physical distribution network. Outsourcing / partnerships This includes not just the outsourcing of the procurement of materials and components, but also the outsourcing of services that traditionally have been provided in-house. The logic of this trend is that the company will increasingly focus on those activities in the value chain in which it has a distinctive advantage and outsource everything else. This movement has been particularly evident in logistics, where the provision of transport, storage, and inventory control is increasingly subcontracted to specialists or logistics partners. Also, managing and controlling this network of partners and suppliers requires a blend of central and local involvement: strategic decisions are taken centrally, while the monitoring and control of supplier performance and day-to-day liaison with logistics partners are best managed locally. Performance measurement Experts found a strong relationship from the largest arcs of supplier and customer integration to market share and profitability. Taking advantage of supplier capabilities and emphasizing a long-term supply chain perspective in customer relationships can both be correlated with a firm's performance. As logistics competency becomes a critical factor in creating and maintaining competitive advantage, measuring logistics performance becomes increasingly important, because the difference between profitable and unprofitable operations becomes narrower. A.T. Kearney Consultants (1985) noted that firms engaging in comprehensive performance measurement realized improvements in overall productivity. According to experts, [ who? ] internal measures are generally collected and analyzed by the firm, including cost, customer service, productivity, asset measurement, and quality. External performance is measured through customer perception measures and \" best practice \" benchmarking. Warehousing management To reduce a company's cost and expenses, warehousing management is concerned with storage, reducing manpower cost, dispatching authority with on time delivery, loading and unloading facilities with proper area, inventory management system etc. Workflow management Integrating suppliers and customers tightly into a workflow (or business process ) and thereby achieving an efficient and effective supply chain is a key goal of workflow management. Theories There are gaps in the literature on supply chain management studies at present. [ 75 ] A few authors, such as Halldorsson et al., [ 76 ] Ketchen and Hult (2006), [ 77 ] and Lavassani et al. (2009), have tried to provide theoretical foundations for different areas related to supply chain by employing organizational theories, which may include the following: Resource-based view (RBV) [ 78 ] Transaction cost analysis (TCA) Knowledge-based view (KBV) Strategic choice theory (SCT) Agency theory (AT) Channel coordination Institutional theory (InT) Systems theory (ST) Network perspective (NP) Materials logistics management (MLM) Just-in-time (JIT) Material requirements planning (MRP) Theory of constraints (TOC) Total quality management (TQM) Agile manufacturing Time-based competition (TBC) Quick response manufacturing (QRM) Customer relationship management (CRM) Requirements chain management (RCM) Dynamic Capabilities Theory Dynamic Management Theory Available-to-promise (ATP) Supply Chain Roadmap [ 79 ] Optimal Positioning of the Delivery Window (OPDW) [ 80 ] [ 81 ] However, the unit of analysis of most of these theories is not the supply chain but rather another system, such as the firm or the supplier-buyer relationship. Among the few exceptions is the relational view , which outlines a theory for considering dyads and networks of firms as a key unit of analysis for explaining superior individual firm performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998). [ 82 ] Organization and governance The management of supply chains involve a number of specific challenges regarding the organization of relationships among the different partners along the value chain. Formal and informal governance mechanisms are central elements in the management of supply chain. [ 83 ] Particular combinations of governance mechanisms may impact the relational dynamics within the supply chain. The need for interdisciplinarity in SCM research has been pointed out by academics in the field. [ 84 ] Supply chain centroids In the study of supply chain management, the concept of centroids has become a useful economic consideration. In mathematics and physics , a centroid is the arithmetic mean position of all the points in a plane figure . [ 85 ] For supply chain management, a centroid is a location with a high proportion of a country's population and a high proportion of its manufacturing, generally within 500 mi (805 km) . In the US, two major supply chain centroids have been defined, one near Dayton, Ohio , and a second near Riverside, California . [ citation needed ] [ 86 ] The centroid near Dayton is particularly important because it is closest to the population center of the US and Canada. Dayton is within 500 miles of 60% of the ",
