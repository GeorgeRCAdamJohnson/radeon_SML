The name RoboCup is a contraction of the competition's full name, \"Robot World Cup Initiative\" (based on the FIFA World Cup), but there are many other areas of competition such as \"RoboCupRescue\", \"RoboCup@Home\" and \"RoboCupJunior\". Claude Sammut is the current president of RoboCup, and has been since 2019. The official goal of the project is: \"By the middle of the 21st century, a team of fully autonomous humanoid robot soccer players shall win a soccer game, complying with the official rules of FIFA, against the winner of the most recent World Cup.\"\n\nRelated topics: IranOpen",

The machines have generally been remote-controlled vehicles rather than autonomous robots. Robot combat competitions have been made into television series, including Robot Wars in the United Kingdom and BattleBots in the United States. These shows were originally broadcast in the late 1990s to early 2000s and experienced revivals in the mid-2010s. As well as televised competitions, smaller robot combat events are staged for live audiences such as those organized by the Robot Fighting League. Robot builders are generally hobbyists and the complexity and cost of their machines can vary substantially. Robot combat uses weight classes, with the heaviest robots able to exert more power and destructive capabilities. The rules of competitions are designed for the safety of the builders, operators, and spectators while also providing an entertaining spectacle. Robot combat arenas are generally surrounded by a bulletproof screen. Competitor robots come in a variety of designs, with different strategies for winning fights. Robot designs typically incorporate weapons for attacking opponents, such as axes, hammers, flippers, and spinning devices. Rules almost always prohibit gun-like weapons as well as other strategies not conducive to the safety and enjoyment of participants and spectators.\n\nRelated topics: Robofest, Robo One, Multi Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge",

Founded in 2015 by Denis Sverdlov, it aimed to be the first global championship for autonomous cars. From 2017 to 2019, the official CEO was 2016\u201317 Formula E champion, Lucas Di Grassi, who later became a member of Roborace\u2019s supervisory board. The series tested their technology and race formats at FIA Formula E Championship events during 2016\u20132018. In 2019 Roborace organized Season Alpha, which consisted of 4 trial racing events with several independent teams competing against each other for the first time. In 2020\u201321 Roborace held Season Beta with 7 competing teams. All teams utilized the same chassis and powertrain, but they had to develop their own real-time computing algorithms and artificial intelligence technologies. In May 2022, Arrival, the owner of Roborace, confirmed that they were no longer continuing the Roborace programme, but that they were hoping to find alternative funding. In February 2024, after getting its stock delisted from the Nasdaq, Arrival's UK division entered administration, with future plans of a sale of Arrival and all of its affiliated assets.\n\nRelated topics: Midwestern Robotics Design Competition, Infinite Recharge (2021), Ars Electronica",
