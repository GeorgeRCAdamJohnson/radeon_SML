## Analysis of Current State (V1.4.2)

### What We Built
- **Current Version**: v1.4.2 deployed on GCP Cloud Run
- **Knowledge Base**: 339 articles, 1M+ words (robotics, AI, automation, ethics)
- **Architecture**: Python Flask + React frontend + Wikipedia crawler + Enhanced reasoning agent
- **Deployment**: https://radeon-ai-960026900565.us-central1.run.app

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Content Quality & Data Pipeline
- **Problem**: Malformed HTML/JSON artifacts from Wikipedia API
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with garbled responses
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient content cleaning and validation

#### 2. Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Problem**: Brittle deployment process, manual fixes required
- **Impact**: Production issues, difficult debugging
- **Root Cause**: No fail-fast mechanisms, silent fallbacks

#### 3. Performance & Scalability
- **Problem**: Linear search, large JSON files in memory
- **Impact**: Slow response times, high memory usage
- **Root Cause**: No semantic indexing or vector embeddings

#### 4. Development Process
- **Problem**: Code sprawl, inconsistent scripts, large PRs
- **Impact**: Technical debt, difficult maintenance
- **Root Cause**: Lack of development discipline and guidelines

### Key Lessons Learned

1. **Content Cleaning is Critical**: Multiple cleaning layers needed for web-scraped content
2. **Fail-Fast Design**: Systems should detect and report issues immediately
3. **Data as Infrastructure**: Large generated files need proper management
4. **Testing is Essential**: Unit tests and CI gates prevent regressions

## Development Philosophy & Anti-Sprawl Guidelines

### Core Principles

#### 1. Fight Code Sprawl
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module does ONE thing well
- **DRY Principle**: Shared utilities, no duplicate code
- **Configuration Over Code**: Use config files, not hardcoded values
- **Interface Contracts**: Clear APIs between components
- **Regular Refactoring**: Clean up technical debt weekly

#### 2. Script Management Strategy
- **Fix Before Create**: Always try to fix existing scripts first
- **Package Entrypoints**: Convert scripts to `python -m package.script` format
- **Documentation**: Every script has usage examples and purpose
- **Testing**: Scripts have error handling and validation
- **Consolidation**: Merge similar scripts, eliminate redundancy

#### 3. Persistence & Grit Mindset
- **Incremental Progress**: Small daily improvements over big rewrites
- **Problem Solving**: Debug thoroughly before asking for help
- **Learning Focus**: Understand WHY things work, not just HOW
- **Quality Over Speed**: Better to build it right than build it fast
- **Long-term Thinking**: Decisions should support 2-year goals

### Enforced Development Rules

#### 1. Document Contracts First
- Every function declares inputs, outputs, failure modes
- Example: `process_query(query:str, format:str) -> {answer, sources, retrieval_count}`

#### 2. Fix Canonical Paths Before Adding Scripts
- If something is broken in main flow, fix it there first
- New scripts only when packaged as reusable CLI entrypoints

#### 3. Tests Required for Behavior Changes
- Any change to agent logic requires unit tests
- Happy path + at least one edge case
- CI must run tests on PRs

#### 4. No Silent Fallbacks
- Fallbacks allowed only with explicit detection and logging
- Stage and Prod must fail-fast instead of silent operation

#### 5. Structured Logs & Metrics
- Emit retrieval_count, sources, fallback flags as JSON
- Include git commit id and agent version

#### 6. PR Size & Review Discipline
- Keep PRs focused: <300 lines ideally
- Larger changes split into multiple PRs

- **Need**: GPU acceleration for sub-second inference

### AMD ROCm Solutions
1. **ROCm + PyTorch**
   - Native AMD GPU support
   - Install: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6`
   - Use with Transformers library

2. **Text Generation WebUI (oobabooga)**
   - ROCm backend support
   - Web interface for model management
   - Supports GPTQ/AWQ quantization

- **Response**: Research alternatives, evaluate risks, prototype solutions
- **Learning**: AMD GPU acceleration expertise for future projects
- **Persistence**: Not accepting 4.5min response times as "good enough"

### Risk Assessment: GPU Acceleration Migration

- **Development disruption**: 2-4 hours to test/rollback if failed
- **Windows ROCm support**: Less mature than Linux (but improving)
- **APU vs discrete GPU**: Different optimization than desktop cards

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Prototype first**: Test llama.cpp + ROCm in isolated environment
- **Fallback ready**: Keep Ollama working during transition
- **Time-boxed**: 2 hours max for initial ROCm test
- **Incremental**: Test one solution at a time

**Decision Gate: PROCEED**
- Clear benefit (90%+ speed improvement)
- Manageable risk (can rollback to Ollama)
- Adequate testing plan (prototype approach)
- Addresses core V2 performance requirement
